Hurkacz tries to run down a brilliant, deep stroke to the corner next up from the Serb and he gets there, but he can only hit it long. That’s 3-0. Hurkacz pats a forehand limply into the net for 4-0, then on the next point, his forehand flicks off the net and bounces long for 5-0. This is some anti-climax after a competitive first set.

                "bodyText": "Anyway, permutations-wise, if Rune beats Sinner tonight (in either two or three sets – it doesn’t matter) then Djokovic is out, Sinner and Rune are through. Djokovic may wonder if Sinner is going to be fully motivated to beat Rune, if losing means avoiding Djokovic later on. The permutations are here on the ATP Finals official site. I’m confused as to why Amazon Prime Video didn’t show Djokovic’s on-court interview. Some weird rights thing, or have they fallen out with the organisers? Djokovic speaks to Amazon Prime Video. Was he upset during that match? He shoots the interviewer a dirty look. “Why was I upset? For what? I lost the set, so … it’s normal.” Next question: How do you reflect on the match? “Good win, good win.” “OK, cheers,” says the interviewer. And that’s it. Amusing. For tonight, Djokovic needs Jannik Sinner to beat Holger Rune if he is to progress to the semi-finals. Now Tim Henman is chipping into the permutations confusion and saying Djokovic would have been out had Hurkacz won the third set, but that isn’t correct. Djokovic just did an on-court interview, but Amazon Prime Video opted not to show it! They’ve been doing pundit stuff instead. How strange. Maybe they’ll show it in a second … Djokovic is really leaning into the ball now and shaping his shots around the court with trademark precision. As I type, he fluffs a shot at the net and the crowd wails, but he’s still in it at 30-30. Hurkacz unsuccessfully challenges a baseline call and it’s match point … and that’s it when the Pole finds the net from the back of the court! *Djokovic 7-6(1) 4-6, 5-1 Hurkacz (*denotes next server) At 0-30 Hurkacz is teetering, but he drags it back to 15-30, and pumps his first accordingly. Djokovic sets up two break points, but Hurkacz cancels them out with two booming aces, then one out wide makes it advantage. However, the Serb comes roaring back with two points of his own, and then wears Hurkacz down on the next, eventually, on another break point. The Pole hits wide, and berates himself, but the reality is it’s 5-1 and nearly all done. Djokovic 7-6(1) 4-6, 4-1 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server) Djoko coughs up a single point on his way to an easy hold. He whips a forehand to the corner to seal the game that Hurkacz can only stand and admire. Djokovic is two games away from a win, but he still won’t be assured of progress until the result of Sinner v Rune is confirmed. *Djokovic 7-6(1) 4-6, 3-1 Hurkacz (*denotes next server) A wonderful exchange from the baseline is won by Djokovic for 15-40. Hurkacz produces a booming, swerving serve for 30-40 … but then he hits long, and the Serb has the break in the third and final set! Game over, effectively? Djokovic 7-6(1) 4-6, 2-1 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server) A straightforward hold for the Serb and world No 1. Hurkacz, by the way, has served 20 aces. The players are having a drink and a nice sit down. *Djokovic 7-6(1) 4-6, 1-1 Hurkacz (*denotes next server) All square in the final set. But it seems that no matter what happens in this final set, Djokovic still needs Sinner to beat Rune tonight, otherwise he is out. There is considerable confusion among the Amazon Prime team about the permutations. But, basically, we are now watching a meaningless final set in terms of the make-up of the last four. Djokovic 7-6(1) 4-6, 1-0 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server) Djokovic holds easily, first up, to begin the deciding set. The permutations are simple, says Robbie Koenig: Djokovic needs Sinner to beat Rune tonight to go through to the last four. Sinner is indeed through to the semi-finals due to Hurkacz winning that set. And he’s the first Italian to reach the last four of the ATP Finals. “If Hurkacz wins a set, I think Sinner is through to the semis,” says Rusedski. But he’s not sure. Neither is Mark Petchey: “If that is true I hope they show a lot of love to Novak in this final set, if that was the sole reason for it,” he says of the Hurkacz-love that was emanating from the crowd. A double fault from Hurkacz after a confident opening winner, and it’s 15-15. A vicious spinning, bouncing second serve is unreturned by tennis’s best-ever returner, and a huge first serve next up makes it 40-15 and two set points. Djokovic returns a second serve with interest, Hurkacz gets it back, but the Serb hits long and it’s the second set for the Pole! Djokovic 7-6(1) 4-5 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server) At 30-30, Djokovic produces a textbook combination of a wide serve followed up by an angled winner to the open court. He then produces more or less a mirror image on the next point and seals the game … the players sit down for a drink. Hurkacz can serve for the second set. On commentary, they were just complaining about the anti-Djokovic sentiment that seems to be bubbling up in the crowd. I think I’d argue they’ve paid their money and are allowed to support whoever they like? *Djokovic 7-6(1) 3-5 Hurkacz (*denotes next server) A double fault and then a careless error by Hurkacz, a backhand into the net, gives Djokovic two break-back points at 15-40. Hurkacz saves one with a familiar ace down the middle. And he does it again! Cracking stuff … deuce. The Pole then goes out wide for a third ace on the spin … and he comes to the net and smashes his way emphatically to the game, having saved two break points! Djokovic 7-6(1) 3-4 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server) Djokovic, remarkably, had gone for nearly 14 minutes without winning a point. He stops the rot with a forehand volley. A classy ace down the middle makes it 40-15 but Djokovic then slams a forehand just wide for 40-30. He finishes the game with a controlled volley, coming to the net. You sense Hurkacz doesn’t fancy another tiebreak … can he hold serve, twice, and force a deciding set? The in-house DJ pumps out a tune while Djokovic sits, motionless and expressionless, no doubt formulating a plan of attack for Hurkacz’s next service game. *Djokovic 7-6(1) 2-4 Hurkacz (*denotes next server) A powerful wrong-footer whipped to the corner by Hurkacz brings up 40-0. And a looping serve down the middle flies off the frame of Djokovic’s racket, and that’s 4-2, Hurkacz backing up the break with a comfortable hold. Djokovic 7-6(1) 2-3 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server) Hurkacz shows another glimpse of the dominant force he can be with a bullying point, smashing for 0-30 after a well-constructed rally. He then belts a powerful, uncompromising backhand return that Djokovic can only dribble into the net. And Hurkacz seals the break when Djokovic double faults! The crowd are getting behind the Pole. Djokovic has what looks like a bad-tempered exchange with his team. *Djokovic 7-6(1) 2-2 Hurkacz (*denotes next server) Djokovic is distracted by some flash photography in the crowd, but it’s academic, because Hurkacz quickly closes out a love hold. The crowd chant “Hubi! Hubi!” Djokovic 7-6(1) 2-1 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server) A sumptuous lob by Djokovic brings up 40-15. Hurkacz jumps but then opts to leave it, and then claps immediately as he realises it’s dropped in. Djokovic wastes no time in clinching the game. Time for a quick drink (the players, not me). *Djokovic 7-6(1) 1-1 Hurkacz (*denotes next server) Hubi levels it up in the second set. It’s good that he hasn’t crumbled completely after a limp showing in the tiebreak, anyway. Over on X, Vladivar reckons that if Djokovic wins in two he’s through to the last four. Maths has never been my strong point so I’m going to stay out of it for now. Djokovic 7-6(1) 1-0 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server) A delightful volley closes out the first game of the second set for the Serb. A mini-break comes immediately for Djokovic … then a poor volley from Hurkacz allows his opponent an easy task in passing for 2-0. Hurkacz tries to run down a brilliant, deep stroke to the corner next up from the Serb and he gets there, but he can only hit it long. That’s 3-0. Hurkacz pats a forehand limply into the net for 4-0, then on the next point, his forehand flicks off the net and bounces long for 5-0. This is some anti-climax after a competitive first set. Djokovic moves to the verge of the first set at 6-0 but Hurkacz finally gets on the board … but another trademark return from the Serb seals the first set. Very disappointing, all told, from Hurkacz in that tiebreaker. Business time for Djokovic, on the other hand. Djokovic 6-6 Hurkacz (*denotes next server) At 15-0, Hurkacz thinks about a challenge when he is adjudged to have hit long. He opts against it, but the replay seems to indicate that the ball was indeed in. I’m not sure if their microphones are broken, but the commentators are silent through all of this. Djokovic closes it out from 30-0 and it’s a tiebreak. *Djokovic 5-6 Hurkacz (*denotes next server) “This feels like perfection to me, I don’t think you can serve any better than this,” says Mark Petchey, on commentary, of Hurkacz’s efforts … “He’s serving against the greatest returner of all time.” His fellow commentator Robbie Koenig isn’t having it, although he does concede Hurkacz is serving well. “Let’s start out own podcast up,” suggests Petchey. No, please don’t do that. Anyway – Djokovic must serve to force a tiebreak. Djokovic 5-5 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server) Hurkacz winds up a big forehand down the line on the second point, and he challenges the call when it lands fractionally wide. No luck this time – and that’s 30-0 to Djokovic. The Serb gives Hurkacz the runaround next up and earns himself three points to bring it back to 5-5 … and he closes out the game easily. *Djokovic 4-5 Hurkacz (*denotes next server) At 40-15, Hurkacz aims for a decisive winner down the line but veers narrowly wide … no bother, he cracks a massive unreturnable serve out wide to edge back in front in the first. Djokovic sits down for a drink and seems to be having a conference with his team, who are sitting on the other side of the court. Djokovic shakes his head over something or other. Can Hurkacz grab this first set? Hurkacz currently has an ace percentage of over 50% on first serve. Djokovic 4-4 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server) Hurkacz, impressively, bullies Djokovic out of the protracted second point of the game to make it 15-15. The Pole dumps a forehand into the next point, though, and then hits long from behind the baseline, and suddenly it’s 40-15. Hurkacz hits long again, and it’s all square in the first. Work to do for Djokovic, anyway. *Djokovic 3-4 Hurkacz (*denotes next server) At 40-15, Djokovic digs out an unlikely return off Hurkacz’s first serve and slowly wrestles control of the point in trademark fashion with some remarkably tenacious hitting. Thus he forces the score back to 40-30, but Hurkacz isn’t fazed, and spanks a big ace down the middle to make it 4-3 in the first set. Tiebreak incoming? Looks that way. Djokovic 3-3 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server) Djokovic seals a love hold with a resounding ace out wide. That was easily the fastest game we’ve had in the first set, no chance for Hurkacz to get close to the Djokovic serve there. *Djokovic 2-3 Hurkacz (*denotes next server) “Could Hurkacz qualify for the semis if he beats Djokovic and Rune loses (to Sinner)?” asks Peter Pluddemann on email. “That would leave three players with 1 win each.” According to this, on the official site, the only thing Hurkacz is playing for is ranking points, not to mention the prestige of beating the world No 1. In other words, tournament rules prevent an alternate who’s only played once from qualifying for the last four. Djokovic 2-2 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server) Textbook from Djokovic first up, serving down the middle then going inside-out with a forehand to the open court. Another serve down the middle – 30-0 – then a drop volley at the net by Djokovic which must have come off the frame of his racket, because he holds his hand up in apology to his opponent. Hurkacz gets on the board with an imperious forehand pass, the kind of shot he can play in his sleep when he’s firing, and then Djokovic errs into the net make it 40-30. Hurkacz comes to the net next up and clips a beautiful approach shot to the corner followed by a winning volley stunned cross-court. And that’s deuce. On second serve, Hurkacz looks well in control of the point, attacking the net and forcing Djokovic deep, but the Serb conjures up a magnificent pass that Hurkacz can only applaud. And Djokovic duly closes it out. *Djokovic 1-2 Hurkacz (*denotes next server) A couple of thumping aces down the middle closes out a simple enough service hold for Hurkacz. That element of his game appears to be working well … The players sit down for a drink. Can Hurkacz put Djokovic’s serve under pressure next up? Djokovic 1-1 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server) A couple of errant strokes from the back of the court by “Hubi” Hurkacz and it’s quickly 0-30 for Djokovic. The Serb powers into the net on the next point for 30-15 … then Hurkacz hustles well to stay in a point, produces what looks a sub-optimal drop shot, which Djokovic runs down, but hits his attempted winner down the line wide. Pressure at 30-30 on the Djokovic serve, but he eats pressure for breakfast. He closes out the game with an ace. *Djokovic 0-1 Hurkacz (*denotes next server) Hurkacz hits long on second serve for 0-15, then tonks an ace down the middle, and an next up an unreturnable serve for 30-15 … Then at 40-30, Hurkacz successfully challenges after a deep ground stroke kisses the baseline. He smiles and shakes his head when his suspicions are confirmed. Djokovic summons up a fantastic return to force deuce … but two more big first serves and the Pole closes out the first game. Djokovic enters the auditorium. “It’s about belief for Hurkacz,” says Greg Rusedski, Amazon Prime pundit. “These conditions should help him … but Djokovic is super-motivated today because he knows he needs to win.” How many matches does Djokovic play when he doesn’t need to win, out of interest? Djokovic loses the toss and Hurkacz opts to serve first. No surprise there. A quick photo with one of the sponsors, and we’re nearly ready to go. Here comes Hubert “Hubi” Hurkacz, who was born in Wroclaw, in Lower Silesia. Perhaps his most famous result was hammering Roger Federer in straight sets at Wimbledon in 2021. And now here’s Djokovic, sporting a natty green tracksuit top. Here we go! The Amazon Prime coverage has kicked in. They start by telling us that Djokovic’s record is 6-0 v the big-serving Hurkacz. Djokovic is doing a few exercises around some cones, while the Polish player is pictured having a spin on a static bike. We’ll see if the crowd in Turin get behind the underdog, Hurkacz, rather than the (normally) all-conquering Djok. The Italian fans were certainly cheering for Jannik Sinner, the Italian, when he beat the Serb on Tuesday. Asked about the raucous crowd, Djokovic said after the match: “I expected it, he’s the only Italian here and he’s playing in Italy. There’s a lot of hype and he’s in great form, so it’s normal.” Nick Kyrgios concedes “the stars have to align a little bit” for him to make a successful comeback after more than a year out of professional tennis. If you happen to like cricket, James Wallace is live-blogging the ODI World Cup semi-final between South Africa and Australia. It’s between innings right now: the Proteas were all out for 210, but it could have been a lot worse had it not been for a heroic 101 by David Miller: Daniil Medvedev booked his place in the semi-finals by beating Alexander Zverev last night: Amazon Prime’s listings state that Djokovic v Hurkacz will start “About 1.30pm GMT” … although I presume for the early match they’ll start bang on time. Does anyone reckon Hurkacz has a chance of upsetting the irrepressible Djokovic? You can email me if you like. Everybody takes a beating sometimes – even Novak Djokovic. Jannik Sinner ended the Serb’s 19-match hot streak on Tuesday, the Italian roared on to a three-set win by the passionate home crowd in Turin. The upshot is that Djokovic may yet be eliminated at the group stage of the ATP Finals, should he fail to beat Hubert Hurkacz today and Holger Rune defeats Sinner tonight. The Green Group could also be determined by a potentially complex tiebreak against those other two players. Hurkacz of Poland is playing a one-off match in Turin as an alternate, following the withdrawal of the injured Stefanos Tsitsipas, but the world No 9 will be a highly dangerous opponent if he finds his range with his powerful serve. For Djokovic, losing one match could be considered unfortunate, losing two would look like carelessness. Can he put one foot in the semi-finals with victory? Match start time: 1.30pm UK.",

“located and destroyed a Hamas naval forces weapons cache, containing diving gear, explosive devices and weapons,” the IDF said.</p> \n  <p>They also “struck terrorists and located weapons including

Instead, “we were met by police pulling on folks that are disabled or have have chronic illnesses, pulling people to the ground in riot gear,” Noble said.</p> \n   <p>Noble, who lives in Philadelphia and is a supporter of the group Jewish Voice for Peace, said no one group organized the protest, but instead it was a coalition of many groups and individuals who support a cease-fire.</p> \n   <p>“It is shameful the way that nonviolent protesters and members of our community were met with violence tonight.

After a summit meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, Biden told reporters:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>Hamas has already said publicly that they plan on attacking Israel again like they did before, cutting babies’ heads off, burning women and children alive.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>It is not carpet bombing. This is a different thing. They’re going through these tunnels, they’re going into the hospital. They’re also bringing in incubators or bringing in other means to help people in the hospital, and they’ve given, I’m told, the doctors and nurses and personnel the opportunity to get out of harm’s way. So this is a different story than I believe it was occurring before, the indiscriminate bombing.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He continued: “The IDF, Israeli Defense Forces, acknowledge they have an obligation to use as much caution as they can in going after their targets. It’s not like they’re rushing to the hospital knocking on doors, you know, pulling people aside and shooting people indiscriminately.”</p> \n  <p>Biden also suggested that a possible hostage deal was imminent, saying the Israelis had agreed to a “pause” as part of the deal, but then stopped short, appearing to acknowledge the uneasiness of secretary of state, Antony Blinken, finally adding: “I’m mildly hopeful.”</p> \n  <p>The forcefulness of Biden’s defence of the Israeli military is notably out of step with recent remarks by senior US officials, who have shifted their emphasis to appeals to the IDF to observe humanitarian law and avoid civilian casualties.

Israel dismissed the resolution as “detached from reality”, while the the permanent observer of Palestine to the UN said the body should hold Israel accountable if it ignores it.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew from the </strong><strong>Shifa hospital complex in Gaza city almost 24 hours after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/15/idf-entered-gaza-al-shifa-hospital-raid-targeted-operation-hamas\">an overnight raid</a> that it called a “precise and targeted operation” against Hamas.</strong> The IDF said it discovered military equipment including grenades, automatic weapons, ammunition and communications technology, confirming what it said was a Hamas command operations centre beneath the hospital.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Hamas denied the claim, which it said </strong><strong>was “nothing but a continuation of the lies and cheap propaganda, through which [Israel] is trying to give justification for its crime aimed at destroying the health sector in Gaza”.</strong></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Muhammad Abu Salmiya, the director of the al-Shifa hospital, said water, electricity and medical oxygen supplies were completely cut off within the facility and he was unable to communicate with doctors</strong>. “We cannot reach the pharmacy to treat patients as the occupation shoots everyone who moves. The smell of death wafts everywhere,” he told Al Jazeera.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Seven staff members at the Jordanian field hospital in Gaza were injured in what Jordan alleged was an Israeli airstrike on the emergency department</strong>. “Our field hospital staff rushed to the emergency section as they saw a number of Palestinians carrying wounded persons, and as our staff got to the emergency room, they got hit again,” the foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said, adding that “many other” Palestinians were killed or injured.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The health ministry</strong><strong> in Gaza did not update the death toll for the fifth consecutive day on Wednesday, due to the collapse in communications and in hospital services in the territory, the UN humanitarian relief agency OCHA noted</strong>. As of 10 November the death toll was 11,078, of whom 4,506 were said to be children and 3,027 women.

                "bodyText": "John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, was questioned by reporters today about the limited evidence Israel has so far produced to back its claim that the al-Shifa hospital was being used as a Hamas command centre and weapons store. Kirby replied: We have our own intelligence that convinces us that Hamas was using al-Shifa as a command and control node and most likely as well as a storage facility. They were sheltering themselves in the hospital, using the hospital as a shield against military action, placing the patients and medical staff at greater risk. We are still convinced of the soundness of that intelligence. He declined to say what if any intelligence Israel had shared on the hospital since its seizure by IDF troops. The questions for Kirby came the morning after Joe Biden’s full-throated support of IDF operations in Gaza, at Shifa in particular. Biden had suggested that the ground operation should be more targeted than the aerial bombing campaign, which he appeared to acknowledge had been less discriminate. Biden said on Wednesday night: So this is a different story than I believe it was occurring before – the indiscriminate bombing. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), has said he believed there was a deliberate attempt to “strangle” its humanitarian work in Gaza. Speaking to journalists in Geneva on Thursday, he said: I do believe there is a deliberate attempt to strangle our operation and paralyse the operation. He added that UNRWA, which supports more than 800,000 displaced Palestinians in Gaza, was at risk of suspending its operations entirely. The UN agency has pleaded for weeks for access to fuel, he said, adding that it was “outrageous” to force humanitarian aid agencies to beg for fuel. A truck carrying 24,000 litres (6,340 gallons) of diesel fuel for UN aid distribution trucks was allowed into Gaza on Wednesday – marking the first time Israel has approved a truck carrying fuel into Gaza since the start of the war. The delivery is nowhere near what people in Gaza need to survive, Lazzarini said, adding: Because of the lack of fuel, we will not be able to send our trucks across the south of the Gaza Strip where we have people waiting for humanitarian deliveries. Israel’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid, has repeated his call for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign. In a statement posted to social media on Thursday, Lapid said there would be broad support to form a unity government led by Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party. A translation of his statement by Reuters reads: The time has come - we need to establish a national reconstruction government. Likud will lead it, Netanyahu and the extremists will be replaced, over 90 members of the Knesset will be partners in the coalition for healing and reconnection. He added: I hear those saying this is not the time. We waited 40 days, there is no more time. What we need now is a government that will deal with nothing other than security and the economy. In an interview with Israel’s Channel 12 on Wednesday, Lapid said “we can’t run an extended [military] operation with a prime minister we do not have faith in.” Efforts to provide medical relief for Palestinians from the Gaza Strip should be concentrated within the besieged coastal enclave, Egypt’s foreign minister said on Thursday. Egypt has received limited numbers of medical evacuees from Gaza this month, most of whom have been taken to Egyptian hospitals for treatment. One group of cancer patients that crossed into Egypt from Gaza was flown to Turkey on Wednesday, Reuters reports. At a briefing for foreign media in Cairo, the foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, said: We have to concentrate on getting medical facilities established inside of Gaza so it can be more accessible to Palestinians who are in need for medical assistance. Shoukry also said there was no truth to reports that Israel and the US had put pressure on Cairo to take in refugees from Gaza in return for debt cancellation, reiterating that Palestinians could not be displaced from their homeland. He said: There’s absolutely no truth and no possibility of any form of displacement of Palestinians outside their homeland, their current location. Egypt has repeatedly said it rejects any mass displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, as Israel’s military campaign there has displaced hundreds of thousands of people towards the south of the territory and a humanitarian crisis has deepened. It is just past 5.30pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: The Israeli air force dropped leaflets overnight on Thursday in eastern areas of Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, telling people to evacuate to shelters for their own safety – suggesting imminent military operations in the area. The flyers told civilians in Bani Shuhaila, Khuza’a, Abassan and al-Qarara that anyone in the vicinity of militants or their positions was “putting his life in danger”, local people told Reuters. Tens of thousands of people displaced from the north have sought refuge in Khan Younis, causing severe overcrowding amid shortages of food and water. The UN is looking for ways to evacuate al-Shifa hospital in Gaza but options are limited by security and logistical constraints, a senior WHO official said on Thursday. One obstacle is that the Palestinian Red Crescent lacks sufficient fuel for its ambulances within Gaza to evacuate patients, according to the WHO regional emergency director, Rick Brennan. The WHO understood that there were still about 600 patients, including 27 in critical condition, at Shifa, he said. The Israeli operation in Shifa hospital continued on Thursday after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) entered the sprawling compound in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Israeli commandos are searching through every building and every floor while hundreds of patients and medical staff remain in the complex, an Israeli military official said. All telecoms services in the Gaza Strip have gone down as all energy sources sustaining the network have been depleted, Gaza’s main telecommunications companies Paltel and Jawwal said in a statement on Thursday. Israeli fighter jets struck the Gaza home of Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political bureau, the IDF said on Thursday. Haniyeh, considered to be the militant group’s overall leader, has lived in Qatar for several years. The UN high commissioner for human rights has said the killing of civilians in Gaza cannot be dismissed as “collateral damage”, while calling for a ceasefire based on humanitarian and human rights grounds. Volker Türk said that five weeks into the war, “massive outbreaks of infectious disease, and hunger” seemed inevitable in the densely populated Palestinian territory. Israel’s UN ambassador has denounced a UN security council resolution calling for a “humanitarian pauses” as “disconnected from reality” and “meaningless”. The UNSC voted on Wednesday to back a resolution calling for “urgent extended humanitarian pauses for [a] sufficient number of days to allow aid access” to the embattled territory. The US and the UK abstained. A group of UN experts said there was “evidence of increasing genocidal incitement” against the Palestinian people in what it said were “grave violations” committed by Israel. A statement said they were “profoundly concerned about the support of certain governments for Israel’s strategy of warfare”. Shelling intensified across Lebanon’s frontier with Israel on Thursday, with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah saying it had fired missiles at eight positions across the border, and Israel saying it had retaliated with artillery. The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, are to visit the Middle East in a multilayered diplomatic push to protect civilians, open fresh humanitarian corridors and keep priming the region for peace talks. Joe Biden has presented an unapologetic defence of his refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, arguing on Wednesday night that Hamas presented a continuing threat to Israel and that Israeli forces were seeking to avoid civilian casualties. The US president also argued that Israeli forces had switched from aerial bombardment, which he seemed to acknowledge had been indiscriminate in parts, to more targeted ground operations. Biden’s remarks come amid escalating tensions between US and Israeli officials over Israel’s future strategy. France has condemned violence by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, calling it a “policy of terror” aimed at displacing Palestinians, and urging Israeli authorities to protect Palestinians from the violence. Israeli police said on Thursday that they had shot and “neutralised” a suspect in a shooting attack at the Tunnels checkpoint between Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem. Relatives of hostages taken by Hamas in its 7 October attack on Israel continued a march from Tel Aviv to Benjamin Netanyahu’s office in Jerusalem as they pleaded for the release of their loved ones held captive in Gaza. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, has said Israel cannot leave a vacuum in Gaza and would have to maintain a strong force there for the near future to prevent Hamas from re-emerging in the Palestinian enclave, in an interview. US Capitol police officers in riot gear clashed with dozens of demonstrators who gathered outside the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington on Wednesday evening to demand a ceasefire in Gaza. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong in Washington taking over the live blog. You can reach me at leonie.chao-fong@theguardian.com. The head coach of the Palestinian football team, Makram Daboub, has said he is “determined to raise the Palestinian flag and win” before his side’s 2026 World Cup qualifier against Lebanon in Sharjah. Palestine have never qualified for a World Cup and the team want to offer their people some hope during the Israel-Hamas war. All telecoms services in the Gaza Strip have gone down as all energy sources sustaining the network have been depleted, Gaza’s main telecommunications companies Paltel and Jawwal said in a statement on Thursday. Most of the remaining Irish citizens in the Gaza Strip will be evacuated within the next three days, Ireland’s foreign affairs minister and deputy prime minister, Micheál Martin, said after meeting an Israeli minister at the site of a Hamas massacre near the Palestinian enclave, the Irish Times reports. The signatories of a statement from the heads of several UN humanitarian agencies that said they would not take part in any unilateral proposals to create “safe zones” in the Gaza Strip included the head of the UN aid agency, Martin Griffiths, and the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Reuters reports. Shelling intensified across Lebanon’s frontier with Israel on Thursday, with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah saying it had fired missiles at eight positions across the border and Israel saying it had retaliated with artillery. In statements throughout the day, the Iran-backed Hezbollah said it had hit eight sites in Israel, including a group of Israeli soldiers, a barracks and other military posts. A Lebanese security source said Israeli bombardment, including drone strikes, hit at least a dozen villages all along Lebanon’s southern border, Reuters reports. The Israeli military said it had struck a cell in Lebanon that had tried to launch anti-tank missiles towards Israel and was firing artillery on to other targets. It said no injuries were reported in shelling on Israel. The Lebanese security source said it was one of the most violent days there since Hezbollah began trading fire with Israeli forces after the eruption of the Hamas-Israel war on 7 October. Hezbollah’s statements said its attacks were “in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip”. The exchanges mark the deadliest violence at the border since Israel and Hezbollah fought a month-long war in 2006. Israeli commandos are searching through every building and every floor of Gaza’s al-Shifa hospital while hundreds of patients and medical staff remain in the complex, an Israeli military official said on Thursday. “The operation is shaped by our understanding that there is well-hidden terrorist infrastructure in the complex,” the official said, declining to be named, according to Reuters. Hamas weapons and equipment had been found in al-Shifa, the official said, adding that “Hamas has persistently worked to conceal infrastructure and cover up evidence” in Gaza’s hospitals. Hamas has denied operating out of medical facilities. France has condemned violence by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, calling it a “policy of terror” aimed at displacing Palestinians and urging Israeli authorities to protect Palestinians from the violence. Speaking to reporters, the foreign ministry spokesperson Anne-Claire Legendre also said that about half of the 100 tonnes of aid that France had sent to Gaza had entered the enclave, Reuters reports. She said it should not be up to Israel to decide the future governance of Gaza, which she said should be part of a future Palestinian state. The UN high commissioner for human rights has said the killing of civilians in Gaza cannot be dismissed as “collateral damage”, while calling for a ceasefire based on humanitarian and human rights grounds. Speaking after the UN security council backed a resolution on Wednesday calling for “urgent extended humanitarian pauses”, Volker Türk said: “The only winner of such a war is likely to be extremism and further extremism.” The White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the US was “deeply concerned that Jordanian medical personnel in Gaza were wounded in an attack near their field hospital”. “Their essential role in conflict must be protected,” Sullivan wrote in a post on X, calling Jordan “a critical ally”. Jordan said seven staffers were wounded in shelling on Wednesday, according to reports. The UN is looking for ways to evacuate al-Shifa hospital in Gaza but options are limited by security and logistical constraints, a senior World Health Organization official said on Thursday. One obstacle is that the Palestinian Red Crescent lacks sufficient fuel for its ambulances within Gaza to evacuate patients, the WHO regional emergency director, Rick Brennan, told Reuters. Egypt was open to having its ambulances cross into Gaza to help evacuate people as long as security guarantees and safe passage could be provided, he said in an interview from Cairo. The WHO understood that there were still about 600 patients including 27 in critical condition at al-Shifa hospital, which Israeli forces entered this week after a days-long siege, Brennan said. He said: We are looking at the case for full medical evacuation but there are a lot of security concerns, there are a lot of logistics constraints. Our options are rather limited but we hope to have some better news in the next 24 hours or so. Those given priority in an evacuation would include the critically ill and 36 newborn babies who lost access to incubators because of lack of fuel to generate power, he said. Plans for an evacuation had been complicated by the fact that communications with the hospital had been cut most of the time, Brennan said. He added: The idea is that we would bring the majority of patients over days or weeks from Shifa. We’d bring the bulk of them to hospitals in southern Gaza but those hospitals are already overwhelmed as well so that’s another complicating factor. The other option is of course to bring a number of them to Egypt. Here is a picture of Ireland’s foreign affairs minister and deputy prime minister, Micheál Martin, during his visit to kibbutz Be’eri in Israel, where the Irish-Israeli eight-year-old Emily Hand was living before being abducted by Hamas. More Irish citizens are expected to cross the border from Gaza into Eygypt today after the arrival of 23 Irish nationals on Wednesday evening. Ireland’s foreign affairs minister and deputy prime minister, Micheál Martin, has travelled to Egypt as part of the diplomatic efforts to free Irish hostages and allow nationals to leave the conflict zone. Martin has confirmed that 23 Irish citizens and their dependents exited Gaza on Wednesday and were received at the Rafah crossing by a team from the embassy in Cairo. He also visited the southern Israel kibbutz where the Irish-Israeli eight-year-old Emily Hand was living before being abducted by Hamas. A group of UN experts said there was “evidence of increasing genocidal incitement” against the Palestinian people in what it said were “grave violations” committed by Israel, Reuters reports. In a statement, the group of experts, which included several UN special rapporteurs, said: We are deeply disturbed by the failure of governments to heed our call and to achieve an immediate ceasefire. We are also profoundly concerned about the support of certain governments for Israel’s strategy of warfare against the besieged population of Gaza, and the failure of the international system to mobilise to prevent genocide. UN experts had previously warned that the Palestinian people were at “grave risk of genocide”. Relatives of hostages taken by Hamas in its 7 October attack on Israel continue a march from Tel Aviv to Benjamin Netanyahu’s office in Jerusalem as they plead for the release of their loved ones held captive in Gaza. The march began on Tuesday and is 40 miles long. The families aim to march between the two cities over five days, camping in tents along the way and arriving outside Netanyahu’s office on Saturday. Family members hold posters of their loved ones and many wear T-shirts with their relatives’ faces on and the words “bring [name of captive] home now!” Russia is concerned about Israeli army raids in the occupied West Bank during which “dozens of people have been killed”, the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said, according to Reuters. The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, are to visit the Middle East in a multilayered diplomatic push to protect civilians, open fresh humanitarian corridors and keep priming the region for peace talks. They will warn that settler violence in the West Bank is “totally unacceptable” and must end. Borrell will arrive today and start with a visit to an Israeli kibbutz that was attacked on 7 October, followed by high-level meetings with Israel’s foreign minister, the UN special coordinator and representatives of hostage families. He will then fly to Ramallah for a meeting with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, followed by meetings in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Jordan involving talks with leaders of those countries along with representatives of Iraq and Kuwait who will be in Bahrain for separate talks. Von der Leyen, who was in Israel in the week after Hamas’s attack, will not return to Tel Aviv this time but direct her efforts in Egypt and Jordan. Sources say the leaders are working in concert to bring a joint message of “a vision beyond death and destruction” to help secure a roadmap for Gaza postwar. Israel is not willing to talk about any “day after” plans and Arab countries are also reluctant but the EU believes it is important to show the Middle East that despite the horrors of the past weeks, there has to be a parallel endeavour to establish a post-conflict plan. Both have already laid out similar roadmaps, which involve: No place for Hamas. No forced displacement of Gazans. No long-term security presence of Israel in Gaza. One Palestinian authority for the West Bank and Gaza. An active role for Europe. On Monday Borrell said the EU had “delegated” responsibility for peace in the Middle East to the US, and Europe needed to step up its leadership in peace talks in the region. Insiders say part of the postwar vision is the EU getting involved in institution-building in Palestine, building of infrastructure, and “not just throwing money” at the region. They say Borrell’s “peace day” initiative aimed at relaunching peace talks is “still alive” with meetings led by the EU, Egypt and Jordan and attended by 60 other delegations at the UN general assembly on 18 September. “Then 7 October happened. But the plan is not dead. We simply have to wait,” said a source. The EU is also pressing ahead with a meeting of Mediterranean countries on 27 November in Barcelona. It consulted with Jordan and other Arab countries and decided to go ahead, acknowledging it would be “difficult”. South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) party said on Thursday that it would support a parliamentary motion calling for the Israeli embassy in South Africa to be closed. The opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) will propose the motion later on Thursday, also calling for the suspension of all diplomatic relations with Israel in solidarity with the Palestinian people amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Reuters reports. South Africa’s strong support for Palestinians dates back to the former president Nelson Mandela’s days, with the country likening their plight to its own before the end of apartheid in 1994. Israel rejects the comparison. In a statement, the ANC said: The African National Congress will agree to a parliamentary motion which calls upon the government to close the Israel embassy in South Africa and suspend all diplomatic relations with Israel until Israel agrees to a ceasefire. The Israeli embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ANC’s remarks and the parliamentary debate. Earlier this month South Africa recalled its diplomats from Israel. The Israeli air force dropped leaflets overnight on Thursday in eastern areas of Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip, telling people to evacuate to shelters for their own safety – suggesting imminent military operations in the area. Similar leaflets had been dropped about two weeks earlier. This time they were followed by heavy Israeli tank shelling on eastern neighbourhoods, Reuters reports. Tens of thousands of people displaced from the north have sought refuge in Khan Younis, causing severe overcrowding amid shortages of food and water. Naming the neighbourhoods of Khuzaa, Abassan, Bani Suhaila and al-Qarara, the leaflets said: For your safety, you need to evacuate your places of residence immediately and head to known shelters. Anyone near terrorists or their facilities puts their life at risk, and every house used by terrorists will be targeted. The UN’s human rights chief said on Thursday that outbreaks of disease and hunger in Gaza seemed inevitable after weeks of Israeli assault on the densely populated city. According to Reuters, at an informal briefing to states at the UN in Geneva after a visit to the Middle East, Volker Türk said: Massive outbreaks of infectious disease, and hunger, seem inevitable. Israeli police said on Thursday that they had shot and “neutralised” a suspect in a shooting attack at the Tunnels checkpoint between Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem, adding that large forces were deployed to the scene. Israel’s ambulance service said its medics were treating five people who were wounded, including one in critical condition, Reuters reports. Thai Muslim politicians said they had received assurances from Hamas that all of the Thai hostages being held would be among those released if mediators succeed in brokering a truce in Gaza, Reuters reports. The Islamist militants took an estimated 240 people hostage on 7 October, and Thailand’s foreign ministry says 25 Thais were among those abducted, and 39 were among those killed that day. More than 30,000 Thais were working in agriculture in Israel, according to Thai government estimates, and more than 7,200 have been repatriated since the crisis erupted. Lepong Syed, the president of the Thai-Iran alumni association, told reporters in Bangkok’s parliament building: Any ceasefire either three days or five days … Hamas will release hostages, including all Thais being held, which they promised. This could be in less than 10 days or in the next two to three days. Lepong is part of a team formed by Thai Muslim politicians, headed by the parliamentary speaker, Wan Muhamad Noor Matha, that has reportedly been in contact with Hamas since October. A man has crashed a car into a barricade near the entrance of the Israeli embassy in Tokyo on Thursday, injuring a police officer, Reuters reports. Police arrested a 53-year-old man at the scene, local media reported. An official at the Israeli embassy said the matter was under police investigation and declined further comment. The incident happened at an area near the embassy that has been the site of a handful of pro-Palestinian demonstrations against Israel‘s bombardment of the Gaza Strip in recent weeks. Police had stepped up security in the area, including erecting the temporary barricades, since the Israel-Hamas war began on 7 October, residents said. A month ago, a staffer at the Israeli embassy in Beijing was assaulted on the street and hospitalised. A bit more background on Ismail Haniyeh, whose house the Israeli military says it has struck in Gaza (although he is believed to be in Qatar). Haniyeh was elected as Hamas’s leader in 2017 and has largely controlled his group’s political activities from outside Gaza. He was the right-hand man to the Hamas founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, in Gaza before the cleric was assassinated in 2004. Haniyeh became prime minister shortly after leading the group to victory in elections in Gaza in 2006 but was shunned by the international community as his group was deemed a terrorist organisation by the US and EU, among others. Hamas then seized control of Gaza from the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority during a brief civil war in 2007. Israeli fighter jets struck the Gaza home of Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political bureau, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have said on Telegram. Haniyeh, considered to be the militant group’s overall leader, has lived in Qatar for several years. The IDF said his house was “used as terrorist infrastructure and often served as a meeting point for Hamas’s senior leaders”. Israeli soldiers had also “located and destroyed a Hamas naval forces weapons cache, containing diving gear, explosive devices and weapons,” the IDF said. They also “struck terrorists and located weapons including explosive belts, explosive barrels, RPGS, anti-tank missiles, comms equipment and intelligence documents”. The Guardian was not able to verify these claims. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, has said Israel cannot leave a vacuum in Gaza and would have to maintain a strong force there for the near future to prevent Hamas from re-emerging in the Palestinian enclave, the Financial Times has reported. According to Reuters, he told the British newspaper: If we pull back, then who will take over? We can’t leave a vacuum. We have to think about what will be the mechanism; there are many ideas that are thrown in the air … But no one will want to turn this place, Gaza, into a terror base again. Last week the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told ABC News that Israel would “for an indefinite period” have security responsibility for the enclave after the war, but the US pushed back saying Palestinians should govern Gaza once Israel ends its war against Hamas. Herzog told the FT that Israel’s government was discussing many ideas about how Gaza would be run once the war between Israel and Hamas ends and added that he assumed that the US and “our neighbours in the region” would have some involvement in the post-conflict order. Joe Biden said on Wednesday he had made it clear to Netanyahu that a two-state solution was the only answer to resolve the Israel-Palestinian conflict and that occupying Gaza would be “a big mistake”. There have been rowdy scenes in Washington, where police have clashed with protesters calling for a ceasefire outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters. Associated Press reports: US Capitol Police said about 150 people were “illegally and violently protesting” near the DNC headquarters building in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington. Members of Congress were evacuated from the building as the protest erupted. Video posted on social media showed protesters shoving police officers and trying to grab hold of metal barricades as the officers moved in to make arrests. The videos also show officers shoving protesters. Many of the protesters were wearing black shirts that read “Cease Fire Now.” Protesters included members of If Not Now and Jewish Voice for Peace, who have organized other demonstrations in Washington. Protester Dani Noble said the demonstrators came to the DNC on Wednesday night to peacefully call on Democratic Party leadership to support a cease-fire in Gaza. Instead, “we were met by police pulling on folks that are disabled or have have chronic illnesses, pulling people to the ground in riot gear,” Noble said. Noble, who lives in Philadelphia and is a supporter of the group Jewish Voice for Peace, said no one group organized the protest, but instead it was a coalition of many groups and individuals who support a cease-fire. “It is shameful the way that nonviolent protesters and members of our community were met with violence tonight. It is absolutely shameful,” Noble added. Here are some of the latest images coming to us from the city of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. Palestinians have fled to the south after being told to do so by the Israeli military, which has however also launched strikes there. Israel’s UN ambassador has denounced a UN security council resolution calling for a “humanitarian pauses” as “disconnected from reality” and “meaningless”. He said in a post on X: Regardless of what the Council decides, Israel will continue acting according to int’l law while the Hamas terrorists will not even read the resolution at all, let alone abide by it. It is unfortunate that the Council continues to ignore, not condemn, or even mention the massacre that Hamas carried out on October 7, which led to the war in Gaza. It is truly shameful! The UN security council resolution, passed late Wednesday after weeks of disagreement among members, calls for “urgent extended humanitarian pauses for [a] sufficient number of days to allow aid access” to Gaza. The US and the UK, two potentially veto-wielding powers, abstained on the resolution on the grounds that although they supported the emphasis on humanitarian relief, they could not give their full support because it contained no explicit criticism of Hamas. Russia also abstained on the grounds that it made no mention of an immediate ceasefire, its top imperative. The resolution, drafted by Malta, was passed with 12 votes in favour, and is the first UN resolution on the Israel-Palestine conflict since 2016. Joe Biden has presented an unapologetic defence of his refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, arguing that Hamas presents a continuing threat to Israel and that Israeli forces are seeking to avoid civilian casualties. After a summit meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, Biden told reporters: Hamas has already said publicly that they plan on attacking Israel again like they did before, cutting babies’ heads off, burning women and children alive. So the idea that they’re going to just stop and not do anything is not realistic. Reports that Hamas beheaded babies in the 7 October attack on Israeli civilians remain unconfirmed, though the brutality of the massacre in which 1,200 people were killed is not in doubt. Biden also argued that Israeli forces had switched from aerial bombardment, which he seemed to acknowledge had been “indiscriminate” in parts, to more targeted ground operations, after more than 11,000 Gazans are reported to have died. He said: It is not carpet bombing. This is a different thing. They’re going through these tunnels, they’re going into the hospital. They’re also bringing in incubators or bringing in other means to help people in the hospital, and they’ve given, I’m told, the doctors and nurses and personnel the opportunity to get out of harm’s way. So this is a different story than I believe it was occurring before, the indiscriminate bombing. He continued: “The IDF, Israeli Defense Forces, acknowledge they have an obligation to use as much caution as they can in going after their targets. It’s not like they’re rushing to the hospital knocking on doors, you know, pulling people aside and shooting people indiscriminately.” Biden also suggested that a possible hostage deal was imminent, saying the Israelis had agreed to a “pause” as part of the deal, but then stopped short, appearing to acknowledge the uneasiness of secretary of state, Antony Blinken, finally adding: “I’m mildly hopeful.” The forcefulness of Biden’s defence of the Israeli military is notably out of step with recent remarks by senior US officials, who have shifted their emphasis to appeals to the IDF to observe humanitarian law and avoid civilian casualties. It seemed to confirm reports that the president is more unreservedly pro-Israel than many in his administration. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war with me, Helen Livingstone. Joe Biden has defended his refusal to call for a ceasefire, arguing that Hamas has said it would attack Israel again and that “the idea that they’re going to just stop and not do anything is not realistic”. Biden also argued that Israeli forces had switched from aerial bombardment, which he seemed to acknowledge had been “indiscriminate” in parts, to more targeted ground operations, after more than 11,000 Gazans are reported to have died. He said: “It is not carpet bombing. This is a different thing. They’re going through these tunnels, they’re going into the hospital. They’re also bringing in incubators or bringing in other means to help people in the hospital, and they’ve given, I’m told, the doctors and nurses and personnel the opportunity to get out of harm’s way. “So this is a different story than I believe it was occurring before, the indiscriminate bombing.” The forcefulness of Biden’s defence of the Israeli military is notably out of step with recent remarks by senior US officials, who have shifted their emphasis to appeals to the IDF to observe humanitarian law and avoid civilian casualties. It seemed to confirm reports that the president is more unreservedly pro-Israel than many in his administration. In other key developments: The UN security council adopted a resolution calling for humanitarian pauses in the fighting in Gaza and the establishment of aid corridors to speed relief supplies to those in need. Russia, the UK and US abstained from the vote, which passed 12-0, the first global agreement since the conflict began last month. Israel dismissed the resolution as “detached from reality”, while the the permanent observer of Palestine to the UN said the body should hold Israel accountable if it ignores it. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew from the Shifa hospital complex in Gaza city almost 24 hours after an overnight raid that it called a “precise and targeted operation” against Hamas. The IDF said it discovered military equipment including grenades, automatic weapons, ammunition and communications technology, confirming what it said was a Hamas command operations centre beneath the hospital. Hamas denied the claim, which it said was “nothing but a continuation of the lies and cheap propaganda, through which [Israel] is trying to give justification for its crime aimed at destroying the health sector in Gaza”. Muhammad Abu Salmiya, the director of the al-Shifa hospital, said water, electricity and medical oxygen supplies were completely cut off within the facility and he was unable to communicate with doctors. “We cannot reach the pharmacy to treat patients as the occupation shoots everyone who moves. The smell of death wafts everywhere,” he told Al Jazeera. Seven staff members at the Jordanian field hospital in Gaza were injured in what Jordan alleged was an Israeli airstrike on the emergency department. “Our field hospital staff rushed to the emergency section as they saw a number of Palestinians carrying wounded persons, and as our staff got to the emergency room, they got hit again,” the foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said, adding that “many other” Palestinians were killed or injured. The health ministry in Gaza did not update the death toll for the fifth consecutive day on Wednesday, due to the collapse in communications and in hospital services in the territory, the UN humanitarian relief agency OCHA noted. As of 10 November the death toll was 11,078, of whom 4,506 were said to be children and 3,027 women. Another 27,490 Palestinians have reportedly been injured. Eight senior politicians from Britain’s opposition Labour party resigned or were fired for defying their leader Keir Starmer’s demand that they not support a resolution in the UK parliament calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Overall, 56 Labour MPs voted for an amendment to the king’s speech brought by the Scottish National party, a major blow to the party leader’s attempts to keep unity over the war. The US navy warship Thomas Hudner shot down a drone that emanated from Yemen in the Red Sea early on Wednesday. It was only the second time the US had brought down projectiles near its warships since the Israel-Hamas conflict began last month. Israel’s former deputy prime minister Gideon Sa’ar told the UK publication Jewish News that his country would agree to a temporary ceasefire in Gaza to facilitate the release of hostages held by Hamas. “It will be achieved. We will see a temporary ceasefire,” he said. His words contradict those of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has frequently and vociferously ruled out a ceasefire. Gaza’s two main telecommunications companies warned of a “complete telecom blackout in the coming hours” in the Gaza Strip. “Main data centres and switches are gradually shutting down due to fuel depletion,” the companies said in a joint statement. The UN children’s agency says its top official visited children and their families in the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, in the south of the territory. “What I saw and heard was devastating. They have endured repeated bombardment, loss and displacement,” Unicef’s executive director, Catherine Russell, said in a statement. “Inside the strip, there is nowhere safe for Gaza’s 1 million children to turn.” Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNWRA, has said: “Our entire operation is now on the verge of collapse,” and that “by the end of today, around 70% of the population in Gaza won’t have access to clean water”. Thomas White, the director of UNRWA in Gaza, has said water pumps and sewage treatment in the south of the Gaza Strip have stopped due to lack of fuel. Egypt’s state-run al-Qahera television station reported on Wednesday that the first fuel truck to enter the Gaza Strip since the war started on 7 October had crossed the Egyptian gate of the Rafah crossing. It was reported to be carrying 24,000 litres. “This is not enough for anything – not for hospitals, not even for aid deliveries,” an international source familiar with the operation told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Israel’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid, called on Benjamin Netanyahu to resign, saying: “We can’t run an extended [military] operation with a prime minister we do not have faith in.” In an interview with Israel’s Channel 12, Lapid did not call for an election but said the ruling Likud party should replace Netanyahu with someone from within its ranks. Qatari mediators were on Wednesday seeking to negotiate a deal between Hamas and Israel that would include the release of about 50 civilian hostages from Gaza in exchange for a three-day ceasefire, an official briefed on the negotiations told Reuters. The deal would also involve Israel releasing some Palestinian women and children from Israeli jails and increase the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza. Hamas has to date released four of the estimated 240 hostages seized from inside Israel’s borders on 7 October.",

If a bowler is on a tear an ODI has enough time to allow the batters to defend and rebuild later. Similarly as bowlers have more overs to use, the skipper can match their bowlers up more effectively with an opposition’s individual batters, to limit their damage. The only format change I would make is to ditch the two new balls and go back to one, to reintroduce reverse swing at the back end of an innings.”</p> <p>Sorry, I meant I dislike the World Cup format in which all the teams play each other. A good ODI, whether a festival of boundaries or a sub-250 dogfight, can be a joy. I like Ricky Ponting’s idea re: the balls. Use two new ones to maintain the hardness but switch to a single ball after 35 overs to enable reverse.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6555f6d28f08945e7e4d0237\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-11-16T11:03:31.882Z\">11.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 79-4 (Klaasen 22, Miller 33) </strong>“That 1999 semi-final has informed the general psyche of all Australian sporting teams,” writes Chris Paraskevas. “I have replayed the final over endlessly on You Tube, rather than the final - which is the game I actually watched as a kid... an underrated win which set the template for Australia’s ruthlessness in the format.</p> <p>“The run-out speaks to everything that underpins the mythology of our sporting spirit: playing to the final whistle and believing the ball will bounce in your favour, especially against the mathematical odds.

But this is an even bigger wicket: de Kock has gone for 3 from 14 balls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"126efb144966a4a7a13c6d51747b61b8b4f13193\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/126efb144966a4a7a13c6d51747b61b8b4f13193/0_0_3946_2680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pat Cummins celebrates after taking the catch to dismiss South Africa's Quinton de Kock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Just look at his face!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2023-11-16T09:04:16.520Z\">at 9.04am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6555d8dd8f08d1d922ef7c04\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-11-16T08:56:22.453Z\">8.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">WICKET!

Van der Dussen tries to land the first counter-punch, walking across to crack a drive that is brilliantly stopped by the diving Warner in the covers. Warner does it again next ball, this time diving to his left. He’ll start his innings on 8 not out.</p> <p>Van der Dussen eventually gets a back-foot drive past him for a couple of runs. The score doesn’t look great for South Africa, and that’s an understatement, but it’s essential they survive this new-ball spell. We know they can catch up later on.</p> <p>“Good morning Rob from a sunny Cape Town,” writes Trevor Tutu. “I was half-minded to stay at home and watch the match on telly, but my conscientiousness kicked in and I set out for work, safe in the knowledge that the OBO would keep me informed.</p> <p>“And what happens when I turn to the OBO? Bavuma is out before he was even in!

He goes up on his own for caught behind after beating van der Dussen with an extravagant legcutter, and another terrific over ends with van der Dussen inside-edging a single.

If they lose de Kock – who has already made four centuries at this tournament, including a tremendous 109 against Australia in Lucknow – the ghosts of World Cup past will be screeching.</p> <p>“Just the start we didn’t need!” writes Duncan Bonnett. “Temba should not have been in the side today anyway – still not 100 per cent fit, by his own admission, and woefully out of form in the World Cup. Reeza Hendricks would definitely have been a better pick, with Markram as skipper.” </p> <p>I know what you mean, and Hendricks batted superbly against England, but it would have been an extraordinary call to drop the captain for a World Cup semi-final. Is there any precedent for that? I feel really sad for Bavuma, who came into this tournament in spectacular form but hasn’t got past 35.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6555d4888f08945e7e4d0031\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-11-16T08:39:45.744Z\">8.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 2-1 (de Kock 2, van der Dussen 0) </strong>Josh Hazlewood’s first delivery lifts and seams to beat de Kock, who then edges wide of slip for a single.

As the penny dropped, in the first fortnight of the World Cup, that South Africa were serious contenders, the cricket world instinctively understood that they would have to beat Australia at some stage. Not in the league stage – though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/12/cricket-world-cup-south-africa-australia-match-report\">they did that handsomely</a> – but in the knockouts, when it really counts.</p> <p>One statistic tells the story of this game. South Africa are hoping to reach their first World Cup final; Australia expect to reach their eighth. This is a humdinger of a semi-final between two teams who have more in common than they would ever dare admit – and fundamental differences that South Africa need to overcome.</p> <p>The history of this fixture is simple: Australia win the games that really matter. In that context, South Africa’s outstanding run of 16 wins in the last 20 ODIs against Australia is almost ominous, because none of those games were anywhere near as big as this.</p> <p>But they have a proven template to beat Australia, and everyone else for that matter: win the toss, bat first, bat big, ideally huge. They are too good not to crack this thing eventually. We’re about to find out whether today is the day.</p> </div>   </div>",

He finds the edge… but the ball flies safe from Starc’s bat, wide of de Kock for four runs. Ouch, that hurts. Steve Finn on TMS thinks Bavuma needs to get his catchers in, there’s no point trying to save runs at this stage, wickets is the only currency for South Africa. Close! Starc is hopping on the crease and nearly plops a return catch to Coetzee in his follow through, the ball just flying wide and up to mid-on. 37th over: Australia 184-6 (Inglis 27, Starc 2) Tabraiz Shamsi finishes with 2-42 off his ten overs. He can’t find the crucial breakthrough off his final over though, five dots are followed by a clip for two from Inglis. Arf. 36th over: Australia 182-6 (Inglis 25, Starc 2) Inglis pops the Proteas balloon by driving a full ball from Coetzee through the covers for four. The required total drops to 31 runs. Getting towards do or die time for South Africa. Maharaj still has one over up his sleeve. Shamsi too, and here he is to bowl it. “Hi James” Hello Colum Fordham. “This has become an unexpectedly enthralling encounter. Whatever the result, Bavuma has marshalled his troops well defending a small total, with excellent bowling changes and aggressive fields. Yes he’ stuck one in the eye to his detractors, not that they’ll skulk off if South Africa succumb. “This ODI does resemble the last session of a gripping test match in some ways, in terms of the palpable tension. A couple of wickets and who knows?” I’d snap your hand clean off for a couple, Colum. 35th over: Australia 177-6 (Inglis 20, Starc 2) Gerald Coetzee has been a potent force for South Africa in this tournament and he celebrated the Smith wicket with proper gusto. He reminds me of a character from StreetFighter, maybe Ryu or Ken? Any Super Nintendo kids out there? Shamsi is recalled by Bavuma and he has six balls at Mitchell Starc. The big leftie bowler manages to clip the fourth ball for a single and the unflappable Inglis returns the strike with the same. Hadouken! 34th over: Australia 175-6 (Inglis 19, Starc 1) Smith bent double over his bat after that catch was taken, he hung his head and trudged off slower than a tractor on a country lane. He can’t believe what he’s done – it was an unneccesary cross batted swipe at a short ball. The Aussies are determined to keep giving South Africa a glimpse of the World Cup final. Huge pressure on Josh Inglis and new batter – Mitch Starc who collects one with a drive into the off side. “Can’t believe someone as experienced as Smith would even consider hitting anything up in the air - so many overs left!” You and the Smudger himself, Dean Kinsella. Smith sends up a skier and de Kock takes a tumbling catch. Stand by your beds! 39 runs plays four wickets. 33rd over: Australia 174-5 (Smith 30, Inglis 19) Rabada replaces Maharaj – perhaps Bavuma is keeping him back for one over if a wicket does fall. Big If. Tidy over from Rabada, keeping the pressure on, just two singles off it. 32nd over: Australia 172-5 (Smith 29, Inglis 18) Gerald Coetzee continues and Steve Smith edges through the vacant slip region for four. South Africa need to make a breakthrough – this Maxwell moment seems a while back now - 31st over: Australia 165-5 (Smith 24, Inglis 17) Maharaj into his penultimate over, three runs worked off him and the partnership between Smith and Inglis goes to 28 runs, the Aussies were teetering like a drunk on a trampoline when Maxwell was bowled. Less than 50 needed now for Australia, South Africa need to go BANG and then BANG. Quite. 30th over: Australia 162-5 (Smith 22, Inglis 16) A big change as Bavuma takes Shamsi off and brings the pace of Coetzee back, it doesn’t go to plan as Inglis uses the extra pace to glide for four wide of slip. Every boundary, nay run, is a wounder for South Africa. 51 needed for Australia, we were firmly in it, but maybe we are now heading out of *SBT? Yes, I am trying to tempt fate. 29th over: Australia 155-5 (Smith 21, Inglis 12) Maharaj into his eighth over, he’s shown why he is the numero uno ODI bowler on the planet today – he has 1-19 so far. He’d dearly want a couple more in the wickets column, just a single off the over. 28th over: Australia 155-5 (Smith 21, Inglis 11) Australia are recovering well here, five runs off the over, Inglis plays a nice looking drive for four to calm a few nerves. 58 more runs needed for the Green n Gold. Five scalps for the Proteas. Where’s your moolah? 27th over: Australia 150-5 (Smith 21, Inglis 6) It’s all or nothing here for South Africa, they have to make some further breakthroughs with the spinners. Inglis nudges a couple and four runs are pocketed off the over. The keeper/bat has had a quiet tournament but all will be forgiven if he can get Australia to the final here. 26th over: Australia 146-5 (Smith 19, Inglis 4) The ball is spinning sharply, Shami and Maharaj have nine overs left between them. This is the key part of this match, if Steve Smith can see them off then Australia have plenty of time to get these runs. Wickets is the crucial equation in the next few overs. A couple more and it is into the tail. 25th over: Australia 141-5 (Smith 19, Inglis 4) Just a single off Maharaj as everybody catches their breath. 24th over: Australia 140-5 (Smith 16, Inglis 2) Inglis clips for two to leg. The crowd are rocking in Eden Gardens. I am twitching on my sofa in south London. “This is beginning to remind me of another game...” Says James Male. “Whatever you call it. No one can say South Africa is choking.” chirps up Arul Kanhere. No. But I might be Arul. Shamsi bowls Maxwell and the atmosphere is electric in Kolkata. A shorter ball that skids on and evades Maxwell’s short arm jab across the line. The Big Kahuna departs the scene and Josh Inglis arrives at the crease. The game is alive. 23rd over: Australia 134-4 (Smith 14, Maxwell 0) MY DAYS. Another eardrum splitting appeal from South Africa as de Kock thinks Maxwell has edged behind off a reverse-sweep. The umpire says not out and the replays back it up, clear daylight between bat/glove and ball. Great decision under huge pressure by Umpire Nitin Menon. DO NOT GO ANYWHERE. Marnus fluffs a reverse-sweep and is given out LBW! He sends for the review but it doesn’t save him. Do South Africa have a sniff here? They need to get rid of the incoming batter almost immediately – his name? Glenn Maxwell. Gulp. HUMONGOUS APPEAL FIRST BALL TO MAXWELL… GIVEN NOT OUT. No edge. No dice. South Africa feel this is their moment though. The ball is spinning like BillyO. 22nd over: Australia 133-4 (Smith 12, Maxwell 0) 21st over: Australia 130-3 (Smith 12, Labuschagne 18) Marnus sweeps Maharaj in front of square for four. Australia working their way towards the target in more sedate fashion than when Head was going ballistic earlier. Zaltz doing his thing. 20th over: Australia 124-3 (Smith 11, Labuschagne 13) Shamsi continues and overpitches, Marnus pouncing on it and driving away for a welcome boundary. 89 more needed for Australia. 19th over: Australia 119-3 (Smith 11, Labuschagne 8) Maharaj looks so dangerous here, he beats Marnus with a beauty that turns off the straight. Australia only need another 94 runs, what South Africa would give to have taken those dropped chances and to have made another 40 runs more in their innings. Shoulda Woulda Coulda. 18th over: Australia 118-3 (Smith 11, Labuschagne 7) Shamsi gets BIG TURN and the ball jags back into Steve Smith who has had a quiet start to the innings. The King of the Nuggets very much in watchful mode, as is his protege down the other end. ANOTHER DROP! Shamsi finds Smith’s edge with a lovely looping delivery but de Kock can’t c,ing on behind the stumps. I make that three spilled chances for South Africa. Their impression of the great Julie Walters is not going to help their chances of reaching the World Cup final. Two Soups. 17th over: Australia 116-3 (Smith 10, Labuschagne 6) A quiet over to start us off again, Maharaj is getting some drift and turn, changing up his speeds. Difficult, difficult, lemon difficult. Just two runs off the over, you might be asking yourself why in the name of the Lord in high heaven did Bavuma not summon his prize left-armer until the 14th over. I know I certainly am. 16th over: Australia 114-3 (Smith 9, Labuschagne 5) Potentially a HUGE moment in this chase as Shamsi spins one into Labuschagne with the batter hanging back in the crease. The ball hits the pad and South Africa very much like the look of it! It is given Not Out on the field but they send it upstairs immediately. Close! The ball was smashing into the stumps but Marnus survives on umpires call as the ball just hit him outside the line of off stump as he shuffled across his stumps. A frenetic first hour of this chase and the players take drinks. Make mine a double! (Alas, tea). 15th over: Australia 109-3 (Smith 9, Labuschagne 2) Marnus replaces Travis Head and with his departure and the arrival of these two it will be death by a thousand nurdles for South Africa unless they keep taking wickets. Maharaj looks dangerous, just three singles collected off his over. Australia need 104 runs, South Africa need 7 wickets. Head is toppled! Maharaj strikes with his first ball. Hope, is that you? 14th over: Australia 104-2 (Head 62, Smith 8) Tabraiz Shamsi is given the nod, strangely no sign of Maharaj yet. Me either. Drop! Another drop! Shamsi takes the edge off a poke from Head and the ball bursts through the hands of Klaasen in the slips. Gah! South Africa cannot afford these missed chances. 100 up for the Aussies. 13th over: Australia 98-2 (Head 55, Smith 7) Head flays Markram through the covers for four. Six off the over, nearly a hundred up for Australia – looking terminal for the Proteas. 12th over: Australia 92-2 (Head 54, Smith 2) Coetzee comes on to replace Rabada. His first ball is short and outside off stump, Travis Head clubs in the air and is DROPPED*. Noooooo! You cannot do that Reeza Hendricks. Tricky chance but Hendricks got two hands to it diving forwards. They are always the hardest to take but my South Africa needed that. Salt meet Wound. Head then muscles the next three ball for consecutive fours! The Walrus tach’d opener is seeing it like a beachball – bunting down the ground and hacking through mid-wicket. FIFTY for Travis Head – off just 40 balls. *Talking of drops – we’ve all been there – haven’t we? This is a lovely piece that has just gone online, originally in The Nightwatchman. 11th over: Australia 77-2 (Head 40, Smith 1) Markram continues and gets away with just three singles off the over. Steve Smith gets a lucky inside edge off a full ball to get off the mark. Batted, Davey. 10th over: Australia 74-2 (Head 38, Smith 0) Power play complete. At this stage South Africa were 18-2. Ahh. Head drives Rabada down the ground for four and then scampers a single to point. Steve Smith is then beaten on the outside edge by Rabada but there’s nay wood on it. 9th over: Australia 68-2 (Head 33, Smith 0) Markram is given another over after making the crucial breakthrough last over. Head drops to his knees (and toes, and toes. Sorry.) and sweeps powerfully for… SIX! Head is going to keep taking it on, if he bats for a few more overs in this vein then Australia will be near enough even if he gets out. 8th over: Australia 61-2 (Head 26, Smith 0) Steve Smith is the new batter. Are we going to see something unbelievable here? Two more quick wickets would make this preety preeety interesting. WHAT A CATCH. Rassie van der Dussen leaps full length at short cover and plucks a full blooded back foot drive from Marsh out of the air! South Africa hit back! Well now, Bavuma tosses the ball to Aidan Markram and it brings the wicket! Warner went back to a full ball and the ball scudded through him and into the stumps. Australia were going at ten an over there. Mitch Marsh is the new batter and he pats back a maiden. A wicket maiden. What a ridiculous sport. 7th over: Australia 60-1 (Head 17, Marsh 0) 6th over: Australia 39-0 (Head 17, Warner 18) Travis Head and David Warner are marmalising South Africa at Eden Gardens. A huge 21 runs are slammed off the over, Kagiso Rabada the chastened man as Warner slogs him for six back over his head and it turns out the bowler has overstepped in the process – FREE HIT. Yep – Warner slots the freebie for SIX. Warner jumps across the crease like a man who has trodden on a dogs tail in a pub beer garden and scoops the full delivery for a maximum into the stands. Rabada tries a scrambled seam delivery and it is picked up early by Head who dispatches it over cow corner for another SIX. Next stop Ahmedabad and India for the Aussies, barring something truly ridiculous. 5th over: Australia 39-0 (Head 17, Warner 18) Cripes. Things are unravelling quickly here for South Africa. Marco Jansen is slapped for 15 runs off the over, Travis Head clubs two fours down the ground but the real gut punch is David Warner’s dismissive flick for SIX off a length ball. Jansen looks like he could cry. Brutal. 4th over: Australia 24-0 (Head 9, Warner 11) Warner smites Rabada high and long over square leg for a huge six! The TV clocks it as 87 metres but it looked double that from my vantage point on a sofa in south London. Rabada does well to limit the damage to just seven runs off the over. Here’s me old mucka Mark Beadle: “Afternoon James, is this a good time to remind everyone that it wasn’t that long ago that Afg had Aus 91-7? How soon do we think spin will play its part?” South Africa have the number one ranked ODI bowler in the word in the shape of Keshav Maharaj, i’d be turning to him very soon to try and make something happen here. 3rd over: Australia 17-0 (Head 8, Warner 5) Marco Jansen is feeling the heat here, he’s carved over point for four by Warner and then sends down three gigantic wides that de Kock does remarkably well to prevent gifting three boundaries to the Aussies. The SA keeper throwing himself around behind the timbers like a greased up Peter Bonetti. One for the kids. South Africa already almost desperate for a wicket. 2nd over: Australia 10-0 (Head 8, Warner 1) Rabada lifts one into Warner’s bat handle, the ball squirts to gully and they take a single. Close! Head flashes at a length ball and the edge flies wide of the slips and away for four. Live and die by the sword eh Trav. 1st over: Australia 5-0 (Head 4, Warner 0) Travis Head shows his intent from the off, throwing the kitchen sink, toaster, kettle and fridge at a wide-ish delivery from Jansen’s second ball that lands just inside the rope. Jansen hangs his head but his teammates give him a gee up. Head tries the same to the next ball but connects only with fresh air. Close! Jansen jags one back that misses the stumps by the width of a Rizzla. A very wide ball down the leg side gifts Australia another run. Five off the first over. Ben Bernards is on the wires: “I don’t think either SA nor AU are really *that* good and as a Kiwi, I would not say NZ were worth any more than another quite satisfactory semi-final finish. Conclusion? a) Yes, SA could absolutely roar back from here and win the game. B) Whoever wins is surely just cannon fodder in the final for the only side that in any way deserves the mantle of World Champ.” These first overs are HUGE. The players are heading out to the middle, Warner and Head in canary yellow with bat in hand, the lissom-limbed Marco Jansen in dark green with the new white orb. Big Marco owes his team a wicket or two after his first ball duck to… Travis Head during the Proteas innings. PLAY! Thanks Rob and hello everyone. Now, call me a misty eyed buffoon if you must BUT I have a feeling in my bones that this might turn into a thriller. Early wickets are key of course but after having South Africa 22-4 and then 119-6 the Aussies find themselves with one of those pernicious little run chases on their hands in a World Cup semi-final. If Travis Head sets off like bullet train rather than an Avanti West coast and Australia have taken a decent chunk of the total down in the power play overs then it’s goodnight Viennetta… but I just have a feeling*. And obviously the sort of ego that will force me to go back and delete this in an hour or so, professional reputation and all that. Jim Wallace is waiting to be tagged in for Australia’s runchase, so I’ll leave you with another gem from the ever reliable Andy Zaltzman. Thanks for your company and emails – bye! David Miller’s verdict It’s really great to get a hundred, but only half the game is done. We fought at the end and got a … a decent score. We know the pitch would be slower and it would turn. We were always on the back foot after losing four wickets in the Powerplay but we managed to salvage something at the back end. Hopefully we can get a couple of early wickets, get that run-rate up as quick as possible and then put some under pressure with our spinners. I do think it’s a defendable score. Australia’s players walk off proudly after a terrificperformance in the field. Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood shredded the top order in helpful conditions, reducing a spellbound South Africa to 24 for four. But Heinrich Klaasen (47) and David Miller counter-attacked after a short rain break, with Miller making a truly brilliant 101. The other 10 batters scored 100 between them. South Africa’s total feels light, but they would have taken it at 24 for four, and they will be encouraged by some extravagant turn for Australia’s occasional offspinners Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head. Before South Africa’s spinners enter the contest, Marco Jansen and Kagiso Rabada need to resist the inevitable onslaught from Head and David Warner. If South Africa take early wickets, the match could develop into an epic. Rabada pumps Cummins to long-on, where Maxwell swoops to make a difficult catch look routine. Australia need 213 to win. You what now? 49th over: South Africa 209-9 (Rabada 9, Shamsi 0) A mark of Miller’s innings is that he has outscored all teammates 101 runs to 92. That doesn’t happen often in a World Cup semi-final, certainly not in a completed innings. The last time it happened, I think, was when Sachin Tendulkar made 65 against Sri Lanka in 1996. Technically that innings wasn’t completed, but I doubt Vinod Kambli, Anil Kumble and Ventakesh Prasad would have made another 20 between them. Kambli was a fine player, I know, and Kumble could bat too, but India were in such disarray that why the hell am I speculating on what might happened in a World Cup semi-final 27 years ago when there’s a real-life one going on right now. Besides, South Africa aren’t done yet. Rabada hooks Starc high over backward square leg for six and takes a leg-bye to keep the strike for the final over. Starc ends a big-game spell with figures of 10-1-34-3. 48th over: South Africa 203-9 (Rabada 3, Shamsi 0) Cummins greets Shamsi with a nasty short ball, then almost cleans him up with a yorker that just misses off stump. Shamsi survives the over, which is the best he can do. David Miller falls trying to hit his sixth six. He fetched a short ball from Cummins towards deep midwicket, where Head took a nonchalant catch on the boundary edge. That’s a huge wicket for Australia, potentially the difference between a target of 204 and 230. It was a glorious innings from Miller: 101 from 116 balls, having come to the crease with South Africa 24 for four and in danger of losing all hope and dignity. 47.1 over: South Africa 202-8 (Miller 101, Rabada 3) David Miller becomes South Africa’s first World Cup semi-final centurion in style, hauling Cummins into the crowd at cow corner. That’s his fifth six. 47th over: South Africa 196-8 (Miller 95, Rabada 3) Starc nails his yorker to keep Miller to a single. Rabada plays his part, ignoring a wide and clipping a couple of runs to leg. Most importantly of all, he gets nothing off the final delivery, which means Miller will have strike at the start of the next over. He probably needs to deal in even numbers from here. Apart from the last ball of the next over obviously. “Like you said, the balance of power and disparities in teams’ levels mean that a ‘perfect’ World Cup format probably doesn’t exist at the moment,” says Matt Dony. “So why not try and level the playing field, and go full Krypton Factor? Sure, Kohli might be the greatest ODI batter ever, but can he land a plane in the simulation? Warner is in a destructive vein of form, but how’s his general knowledge? The England side would probably have excelled at the obstacle course, pushing them up a few places. We’d all watch that!” For our non-British readership, this is what the hell Matt Dony is talking about. Starc replaces Zampa, who is nursing figures of 7-0-55-0. He’s too crafty for Maharaj, who toe-ends a wide delivery high in the air to mid-off. South Africa have 22 balls remaining, and if they get a run a ball it’ll take them to [WILL YOU SHUT UP ABOUT THE 1999 SEMI-FINAL – ed]. 46th over: South Africa 190-7 (Miller 94, Maharaj 4) Miller’s score is the highest by a South African in a men’s World Cup semi-final, passing Faf du Plessis’ 82 against New Zealand in 2015. He moves into the nineties with a ferocious, beautifully placed pull for four off Cummins. It’s been an exemplary innings, one that will become career-defining if South Africa find a way to win. And cricket is a funny old game, because Miller was very close to being caught at slip for a golden duck. “Keeping well old bean?” says David Bowen. “I was just speaking to a customer who is South African and he was hopping with rage. ‘From not knowing the Duckworth Lewis rule correctly to dropping catches, they always freeze at the semi-finals. They can’t seem to get it over the line despite playing well in the group’. I replied, ‘South Africa are the Tottenham Hotspur of cricket’. The response suggested I’d probably overstepped the customer-supplier boundary (no pun intended, unless you like it, in which case it is intended).” 45th over: South Africa 182-7 (Miller 88, Maharaj 2) Zampa continues, a fascinating decision for which he’ll be heavily criticised if Australia lose. Miller heaves the first ball for four, but once again Zampa pulls the over back impressively: 420101. 44th over: South Africa 174-7 (Miller 81, Maharaj 1) Oh good lord, we’ve got another addition to South Africa’s World Cup tales of woe. Coetzee didn’t glove the ball at all – it hit his arm before being caught by Inglis. Coetzee did discuss a review with Miller but neither player was sure. And because Marco Jansen wasted an earlier review, they decided not to risk the last one. Cummins ends a good seventh-wicket partnership of 53. After a number of slower balls, he rammed in a sharp bouncer that Coetzee, trying to hook, gloved down the leg side. That’s a useful wicket because Coetzee was playing a good supporting role. 43rd over: South Africa 171-6 (Miller 79, Coetzee 19) A brave move from Pat Cummins, which is an odd thing to say when he is recalling his best bowler. But David Miller has an exceptional ODI record against Adam Zampa – 150-odd runs, no dismissals – so it’s a risky move, even if Zampa is brilliant at making batters fall on their sword. Miller launches a flat straight six, his fourth off Zampa in this innings, but the rest of the over is really good. Seven off it in total. 42nd over: South Africa 164-6 (Miller 72, Coetzee 19) Starc off, Cummins on. Miller smacks two to deep cover, where Warner again fields like a 20-year-old. Cummins goes to his slower balls, three in a row, and Miller can’t get them away. Four from the over. Since you asked, Australia were 165/6 at this stage in 1999. Come on, that’s pretty eerie. “For T20 WCs, they tend to have a ‘pre-tournament’ for the lesser lights, but which is technically still part of the wider thing,” says Patrick Brennan. “Why not have: 8 automatic qualifiers (always including host/s) 2/4 remaining spaces decided by pre-qualifying, in which the next eight highest-ranking teams are split into two groups of four, play each other and the winners/top two qualify 10/12 teams in the main World Cup, with two groups of five/six. Top two of each group qualify for the semi-finals. “Total – 35/45 games; max five and a half weeks (40 days or so).” With Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger narrating the official videeo. Your plan would almost certainly make for a better tournament, but it feels a bit Nations League. For no particular reason I like World Cups that are neat and symmetrical. 41st over: South Africa 160-6 (Miller 69, Coetzee 19) Miller and Coetzee collide while taking a single, but thankfully for South Africa it doesn’t descend into farce, with both men on all fours in the middle of the pitch, Miller trying to crawl past Coetzee to ensure he isn’t the man who is run out. Four singles from Head’s over. He and Zampa both have five lieft. “In Nasser’s analysis of England’s performance (I know this isn’t about them but please bear with me) he suggested that they were exhausted after a gruelling home summer particularly the Ashes,” says Digvijay Yadav. “Well, surely that should also afflict the Australians? Since they have the same coach and captain in this format. “Athers suggested that England struggle to prioritise both red ball and white ball cricket simultaneously. Again, from 2019-21, NZ reached the final of both white ball global events and won the WTC. This year we might have the same finalists for both the WTC and the WC. Again, why should that be an issue?” It’s partly because England play more cricket, though that doesn’t explain why it’s such a recurring problem. It was the same when Eoin Morgan’s ODI team and Michael Vaughan’s Test team excelled. Even when England dominated Test cricket in the 1950s, they didn’t win a single white-ball match. 40th over: South Africa 156-6 (Miller 67, Coetzee 18) Maxwell shakes his head ruefully after being Miller again. He ends another handy spell with figures of 10-0-35-0. At this stage of the famous 1999 semi-final, the team batting first were 158 for six. Maybe we misinterpreted the big man earlier in the day. 39th over: South Africa 154-6 (Miller 66, Coetzee 17) Mitchell Starc replaces Maxwell, who has one over remaining. He starts arond the wicket to Coetzee, who lasers a drive through extra cover for four. That’s a terrific shot. The length of South Africa’s tail in this tournament has probably been overplayed. Coetzee, Maharaj and Rabada can all bat. It helps that they are playing all three today; in some games they have had two No11s in Shamsi and Ngidi. Afternoon Ollie. 38th over: South Africa 149-6 (Miller 66, Coetzee 12) Miller drags Maxwell over midwicket for another four, a good shot rather than a poor ball. In his two World Cup semi-finals he has scored 115 runs off 104 balls, so he’s exempt from any criticism. So, for the time being, is Coetzee, who is playing a sensible supporting role. South Africa are inching towards a competitive score. 37th over: South Africa 141-6 (Miller 60, Coetzee 10) A statbox shows that Head, a part-time finger-spinner, is getting 4.3 degrees of turn, the most at this World Cup. Just two singles from Head’s fourth over. The way it’s turning means South Africa are still in this contest. I think. 36th over: South Africa 139-6 (Miller 59, Coetzee 9) Maxwell undoes a terrific over with a half-tracker that Miller belabours through midwicket for four. He screams with frustration at giving away such a cheap boundary. The other concern for South Africa is that, whatever target they set, the ultra-aggressive pair of Travis Head and David Warner could end the contest before the spinners on. It’s a fascinating struggle; we’re at the sweet spot where it’s possible to envisage a crushing win for one team, a nerve-shredding win for the other or anything in between. 35th over: South Africa 134-6 (Miller 55, Coetzee 8) A flighted half-volley from Head is spanked to the cover boundary by Coetzee. Later in the over Miller is beaten by a ripper, the kind of delivery Muttiah Muralitharan would have happily called his own. If Travis Head is doing that, Keshav Maharaj – the world’s No1 bowler – should have exceedingly moist lips. “What’s the best format possible for a World Cup?” says Arul Kanhere. “Given it should ensure enough jeopardy and an increased number of teams while finishing in under 30 days.” I would start with the ideal that no team should be able to lose more than two games and still win the competition, then work back from there. I guess that would mean four groups of four, which will never happen for obv£io$ reasons. And even four groups of four is not ideal. As in rugby, the current balance of power makes it very difficult to find a good format. 34th over: South Africa 129-6 (Miller 55, Coetzee 3) With Coetzee getting his eye in, Maxwell hurries through another over. One ball turns sharply to hit Coetzee just outside the line; the next goes straight on to take the edge and fly past Inglis for a single. It’s spinning out there. 33rd over: South Africa 125-6 (Miller 54, Coetzee 2) Travis Head skids one past Coetzee’s outside edge. Two from the over, which was completed in about two minutes. That’s drinks. 32nd over: South Africa 125-6 (Miller 53, Coetzee 1) Now Maxwell gets one to rag past Miller’s outside edge. There’s a stumping referral after good work from Inglis, but Miller’s back foot went nowhere. South Africa have two proper spinners plus Aidan Markram, so even a modest score of around 200 might be competitive. They’ll regret it forever if they fold for 150-odd. Their best hope of reaching a half-decent score is David Miller. He lashes Maxwell through extra cover for four to reach an aggressive, fiercely determined half-century from 70 balls. 31st over: South Africa 119-6 (Miller 48, Coetzee 0) Coetzee survives the hat-trick ball, another big offbreak. Head turned it more in that over than Zampa and Maxwell combined, which suggests Keshav Maharaj will be South Africa’s key bowler. Klaasen will be filthy about his dismissal. He’s such a good player of spin and had spanked 25 off the previous 13 deliveries. And then he went and spoiled it all by doing something stupid like missing a straight one. Jansen pushed outside the line of a big offbreak that hit him on the kneeroll in front of off stump. He reviewed apologetically, almost sheepishly, and replays confirmed what he already knew: it was hitting leg stump and South Africa lose a review. More to the point, Travis Head is on a World Cup semi-final hat-trick! Marco Jansen has gone first ball! He’s reviewed it but this looks plumb. Good captaincy from Pat Cummins, who decides to save Adam Zampa’s last five overs in the hope that one or both of these batters will have buggered off by the time he returns. One of them is buggering off as we speak! Heinrich Klaasen smashed the occasional offspinner Travis Head for consecutive boundaries but then played defensively down the wrong line and was cleaned up. A peculiar shot to end an excellent innings of 47 from 48 balls. 30th over: South Africa 111-4 (Klaasen 39, Miller 48) “There’s so many complaints from Joe Punter about the tournament format,” says Ben Bernards. “Would some of those complainers like to put in writing their preferred format, and which ills it would remedy? There are at any given moment six teams – at best – who have any realistic chance of winning the big cup, and we saw here that England and Pakistan were never at the races. “With such a miserable diet of ODI cricket being played, you can’t realistically base a two-group stage on rankings or you could quite feasibly end up with your big guns lumped into the same side of the draw. It’s grumbling for the sake of it IMO until some bright spark shows me the light of their superior proposal.” If you can find a time machine I’ll go back to 2003 and ask Martin Williamson. I agree that the balance of very good/good teams makes this awkward, but the league stage is too long and doesn’t have enough jeopardy. Dammit, man, give me jeopardy. 29th over: South Africa 108-4 (Klaasen 37, Miller 47) Smith misses a run-out chance. Klaasen took a dodgy single to mid-off and was just short when Smith’s throw flashed past the stumps. Klaasen collided with Zampa afterwards, and there’s a short break in play while he receives treatment. He’s fine. Zampa, not so much. He bowls a high full toss that is blootered over midwicket for six by Miller. Zampa has been unusually ragged, probably because he’s conscious of his poor head-to-head records against Klaasen and Miller. Figures of 5-0-40-0 won’t improve it. 28th over: South Africa 100-4 (Klaasen 36, Miller 40) Maxwell changes ends and is milked for five runs. It’s interesting that South Africa are going after the specialist spinner rather than the second in command. I suppose they have happy memories of batting against Zampa. 27th over: South Africa 95-4 (Klaasen 35, Miller 35) Zampa replaces Maxwell, who raced through a spell of 3-0-4-0 – and Klaasen jumps all over him with successive sixes. Both deliveries were only slightly short, but Klaasen rocked back to maul them over midwicket. This is an admirable response to extreme adversity from Klaasen and Miller, who have added 71 in 15 overs. 26th over: South Africa 81-4 (Klaasen 22, Miller 35) Cummins switches around the wicket to Miller, who clatters a couple through the covers. Batting looks more comfortable now, and South Africa will constantly be revising what they think is a competitive score. “Rob, why is it you dislike ODIs as a format?” says Isaac Forster. “For me they strike a good balance between the ridiculous T20 and Hundred thrash and the more circumspect aspects of Tests. If a bowler is on a tear an ODI has enough time to allow the batters to defend and rebuild later. Similarly as bowlers have more overs to use, the skipper can match their bowlers up more effectively with an opposition’s individual batters, to limit their damage. The only format change I would make is to ditch the two new balls and go back to one, to reintroduce reverse swing at the back end of an innings.” Sorry, I meant I dislike the World Cup format in which all the teams play each other. A good ODI, whether a festival of boundaries or a sub-250 dogfight, can be a joy. I like Ricky Ponting’s idea re: the balls. Use two new ones to maintain the hardness but switch to a single ball after 35 overs to enable reverse. 25th over: South Africa 79-4 (Klaasen 22, Miller 33) “That 1999 semi-final has informed the general psyche of all Australian sporting teams,” writes Chris Paraskevas. “I have replayed the final over endlessly on You Tube, rather than the final - which is the game I actually watched as a kid... an underrated win which set the template for Australia’s ruthlessness in the format. “The run-out speaks to everything that underpins the mythology of our sporting spirit: playing to the final whistle and believing the ball will bounce in your favour, especially against the mathematical odds. It wasn’t just that SA melted down epically: an image of the Aussies circling like sharks around the stumps should be (and probably is) on display permanently display in the National Museum of Australia...” It’s fascinating that half the Australian players didn’t even know they had gone through. They just knew they hadn’t lost, and that was enough of a reason to go mad. 24th over: South Africa 77-4 (Klaasen 21, Miller 32) There are echoes of past semi-finals elsewhere. Right now Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller are playing Steve Waugh and Michael Bevan in 1999, trying to rebuild after the loss of four early wickets. That pair added 90; Klaasen brings up the fifty partnership here by cutting Cummins decisively over point for four. The pitch, as Ricky Ponting notes on commentary, is playing better now. I thought South Africa were gone at 22 for four but this pair have given them a chance. 23rd over: South Africa 71-4 (Klaasen 16, Miller 31) Maxwell screams in vain for LBW when Miller is late on defensive push. It was definitely pad-first but he was outside the line. Another tight over from Maxwell, one from it. 22nd over: South Africa 70-4 (Klaasen 16, Miller 30) Klaasen mistimes a pull off Cummins that lands well short of deep midwicket. Miller, who looks busier and is batting with more rhythm, steals a run on the off side. “Not that the ICC are like this,*” begins Andy Flintoff, “but like FIFA, they’re choosing a format for the World Cup with lots of games in the group stages to reduce the chances of the big teams failing to qualify, which means there are lots of games that don’t have much riding on them. “The only interest in this tournament that persisted was the fact that it was suddenly discovered that only the top seven would qualify for some almost-meaningless ODI not-World Cup in the next cycle, so there was a possibility that big teams (and England) wouldn’t make it. “ * They are definitely like this.” I blame the millions of cricket fans who dined out on schadenfreude when India lost to Bangladesh in 2007. 21st over: South Africa 68-4 (Klaasen 15, Miller 29) Maxwell replaces Zampa, who was Millered for 18 from his three overs. A quiet over, just one from it. Maxwell has an outstanding economy rate in this tournament, just below five an over. 20th over: South Africa 67-4 (Klaasen 14, Miller 29) Cummins replaces Hazlewood at the Let The Pitch Do The Work End. Klaasen, hitherto restrained, drives a simple single into the off side. Miller is the one doing the heavy lifting at the moment, and he moves to 29 with an emphatic clip through midwicket for four. This pair have added 43 either side of the rain break. There’s still a long way to go but they’ve made a start. Perhaps the rain delay helped them more than Australia. 19th over: South Africa 62-4 (Klaasen 13, Miller 25) One more wicket would break this open for Australia. While the No7 Marco Jansen is a dangerous death hitter, I’m not sure he’s a 70/5 man. Miller drives Zampa handsomely over wide long-on for six more, a brave and decisive stroke. South Africa have to take a piece of somebody if they are to win this game – Zampa isn’t the easiest man to attack, but it looks like Miller is going after anything tossed up. “Just read that Wisden report of the Australian go-slow vs West Indies in 1999,” says Pete Salmon, “and I have to say that the final line - ‘and victory came from a no-ball’ – is one of the funniest I’ve ever read. Already thinking of the wonderful bathos I can add to any situation by quoting it – at a crime scene, or at the end of a bad date the moment she leaves. Or perhaps at the end of this match?” Or an episode of EastEnders, a millisecond before the doof-doofs kick in. 18th over: South Africa 55-4 (Klaasen 12, Miller 19) Even the algorithms are trolling South Africa: the official score predictor reckons they are on course to make 213, a very evocative number in this fixture. It looks like South Africa have decided to see Hazlewood off unless he bowls a rank bad ball, which he won’t. It’s another maiden, this time to Miller, who is hit painfully on the glove by a short ball. Hazlewood has stunning figures of 8-3-12-2; they don’t flatter him. 17th over: South Africa 55-4 (Klaasen 12, Miller 19) Miller muscles Zampa over long-on for the first six of the match. South Africa aren’t quite out of this, but they need Klaasen and Miller to bat for at least the next 15 overs. “I’m struck by how poorly Bavuma is playing in this World Cup,” writes Nick, “particularly given he was in good form against Australia just prior. My question: of teams that have reached the semi-finals of a World Cup, is this the worst performance by a batting captain?” I’m afraid that dubious honour goes to another South African, Hansie Cronje in 1999. His scores were 27, 8, 16, 4, 4, 39, 0 and 0, though he was wrongly given out in the semi-final. 16th over: South Africa 46-4 (Klaasen 11, Miller 11) Selfless stuff from Pat Cummins, who replaces himself with Josh Hazlewood. He knows that Hazlewood, having had half an hour’s rest, is the most dangerous bowler in these conditions. It sounds obvious but there are plenty of bowling captains would have wanted a piece of the pie for themselves. Klaasen pushes nervously, feet stuck in cement, and is beaten outside off stump. An immaculate maiden from Hazlewood. “Wouldn’t it be lovely if SA finished around 250-280, setting up a good ol’ fashioned ODI chase for Aus under lights?” says Anand. “As someone who watched a lot of cricket in the 1990s, there is a certain allure to those ODI chases.” Better still, why not set them 214 on a turning pitch? 15th over: South Africa 46-4 (Klaasen 11, Miller 11) Zampa immediately skids one past Miller, pushing nervously outside off stump. Two from the over. South Africa need to bat their 50 overs, not just to get as many runs as possible but to increase the (admittedly small) chance of the game being washed out. Here we go again. The players are back out on the field, and Adam Zampa is coming on to replace Mitchell Starc. “It’s such a shame that while this tournament has featured some genuinely exhilarating play (Maxwell, Gurbaz, de Kock, everything India has done), so little of it has coincided with the other side also playing well,” says Mike Jakeman. “I know you’re a bit more forgiving of this format than I am, but I think it is pretty sad that we now have a single game left in which we might see a genuine thriller. “One of the weaknesses of T20 is that the games are so compressed that there is a large element of randomness as to which team wins on any given day. ODIs are supposed to have a bit more breathing space and ebb-and-flow. But we’ve seen so little of that. Having said all that, if India win the toss and bat against Australia on Sunday, the first ten overs will be gripping, even if the rest of the match is not.” It’s been the poorest World Cup I can remember apart from 2007. I’ve grown to dislike this format, and I wonder if we have a rose-tinted view of 1992 because England did so well and Pakistan were so exhilarating. Ultimately the league stage of that competition was pretty predictable as well – New Zealand and England cruised through and South Africa clinched their place with a game to spare (I think). In 2027 there will be two groups of seven, which isn’t great either. We’ve been having this discussion for as long as I can remember. During the 2003 World Cup, my Wisden.com editor Martin Williamson came up with a format that seemed perfect. Neither of us wrote it down, and neither of us could remember it when the subject next came up. “Look at it this way,” says John Starbuck. “Your article in today’s Big Paper will benefit from the idiocies of today’s match, whoever wins/loses, and you’ll be able to reproduce it as a podcast too. The rain not even raining properly is just an extra element added for spice.” It’s weird – I’m a neutral but I find the end of that 1999 semi-final almost chilling in its intensity and cruelty, much more so than the 2019 final. The depth and breadth of South Africa’s World Cup trauma might be unprecedented in elite sport, and this could be another new twist: the unseasonal Kolkata weather that turned a toss South Africa were so desperate to win into a good toss to lose. The covers are coming off and, unless it rains again, the match will resume in just over 10 minutes. “Hi Rob,” writes Paul Walsh from Kolkata. “Still a little rain in the air, very unseasonal. Catching up with street chowmin from next to Crow Field, our rugby pitch on the Maidan!” If it does rain for the next 36 hours, it’ll be karmic payback for Old Trafford South Africa will go through. Imagine if, after all that brilliant cricket and all those heartbreaking near misses, they finally reached a World Cup final after being sliced and diced by Australia’s new-ball bowlers. It’s still raining, so I’m off to grab a coffee. Be back in a bit. Meanwhile, here are some more of your emails. “Being an Australian in a wet, cold, rural Somerset is sometimes not much fun,” writes Cath Hanley, “but I think my day is brightening …” “At the alliteratively appealing 44-4 off 14 (to which for good measure my brother added ‘FFS’ in his text),” begins Brian Withington, “where does this fit in the pantheon of great tosses to lose?” “Hello Rob,” says Krishnamoorthy V. “Looks like it will be a T20 game even without the rain!” “It occurs to me that if Australia wanted to be really cruel, like a cat toying with its prey, having bowled SA out for say, 50, they could slowly accumulate the 51 required to win at one run per over, for 49 overs, with two runs from the final over, perhaps even the final ball,” says Kim Thonger. “Do they have that sadistic streak in them? Hmmm.” It has happened before, sort of. “I’m sure I’m not the only one thinking, ‘Are Australia in danger of pulling out the perfect game one match too soon?’” says Scott Probst. “A bit like the English beating the All Blacks in the rugby World Cup in Japan and then going down to South Africa without a great showing in the next game? Thoughts?” My first thought is that the sporting psyches of the two countries are very different. Historically, Australia are more likely to follow a perfect performance with an even better one. “Been a bit late checking the scores today,” says Anand. Has anyone blamed anyone else for changing the weather for this match?” 1992 World Cup draft These podcasts are lots of fun to record. If you’re a cricket nerd, you’ll like them. And if you’re not, just vote for somebody to get our poll moving. “G’day Rob,” writes Chris Paraskevas. “Only catching my first glimpses of this because Australia v Bangladesh has had prime slot on the tele till now (for clarification: that’s a game of football). Is it fair to say that Australia are doing their best nationalmannschaft impersonation and peaking at precisely the right moment? Starc in particular is so adept at timing his rhythm and buildup at major tournaments - his consistency in the big games is unreal. He and Hazlewood don’t click anywhere near enough at ODI level, but when they do... few pairs are better.” The intensity of this performance has been mildly frightening – not just the bowling but also the brilliant, aggressive fielding of Warner and Labuschagne. They saved five or six boundaries between them. It doesn’t seem too bad so hopefully it will only be a short stoppage. South Africa will hope it rains for the next 36 hours: if there’s no result they will go through on a vile technicality by virtue of finishing higher in the league stage. 14th over: South Africa 44-4 (Klaasen 10, Miller 10) Pat Cummins replaces Hazlewood, who bowled a masterful Test-match spell of 6-1-12-2. His first ball is driven crisply through extra cover for four by Klaasen, who then steals a second run on the leg side. That kind of controlled positivity is South Africa’s only chance of getting back into this match. Miller, who looks understandably nervous, chips Cummins just short of Hazlewood at mid-on, with the ball bouncing past him for four. Time for drinks. South Africa need a stiff one. “It’s easy to say with hindsight that Bavuma shouldn’t have batted first in muggy overhead conditions but perhaps it wouldn’t have taken that much foresight to have imagined the consequences of facing Starc, Hazelwood and co in this context,” says Colum Fordham. “I am rooting for South Africa but unless Miller and Klaasen play special innings, this match is virtually over. The Proteas’ woes are being compounded by the Australian’s stunning fielding.” It was a fiendishly difficult decision because South Africa are so much better batting first. And although it’s muggy, you never know how much the ball will move until you get out there. I still think he made the right decision at the time, though I appreciate that sounds absurd at 40-odd for four. 13th over: South Africa 32-4 (Klaasen 3, Miller 5) Klaasen chips Starc just short of cover. This is Starc’s seventh over, apparently the longest spell of his ODI career. He’s starting to tire a little and will probably be replaced after this over. “Baby it’s cold outside,” says Sarah Bacon. “but I’m feeling all gooey and warm from the marvellous start Oz has made this morning. I really do need to leave – have to drop the car in to be serviced – but with South Africa’s run-rate hovering around TWO after 12 overs, it’d be churlish to depart, amirite? And FOUR wickets down is just ... staggeringly good.” They’ve been magnificent. 12th over: South Africa 28-4 (Klaasen 1, Miller 4) David Miller edges his first ball just short of slip, with the ball bouncing through for four runs. Just as in the 2007 semi-final, Australia have surely won the game with the ball in the first hour. Australia’s bowling has been relentless. People will talk about South Africa bottling another semi-final, but even India would struggle cope with this. It was another immaculate delivery from Hazlewood that van der Dussen, pushing defensively, edged straight to second slip. He fought desperately hard to survive, but the drip-drip effect became too much. My days, this is brutal. 11th over: South Africa 22-3 (van der Dussen 5, Klaasen 0) Mitchell Starc has figures of 6-1-14-2, and I don’t know what else to say. Markram sliced an impatient drive to backward point, where Warner held a sharp two-handed catch to his left, threw the ball up and did a jaunty little dance on the spot. Australia have been fantastic. David Warner does a silly little jig of delight after catching Aidan Markram at backward point. South Africa are in all sorts. 10th over: South Africa 18-2 (van der Dussen 5, Markram 6) Hazlewood is bowling so well that Cummins will extend his first spell for as long as possible – even though he must be itching for a crack himself. Markram is too early on a pull and gloves the ball into the off side. The next ball, a beauty, jags back to cut him in half. This is a merciless test of South Africa’s mettle. 9th over: South Africa 17-2 (van der Dussen 5, Markram 5) Labuschagne saves three with a marvellous diving stop at extra cover. That’s four great stops in the covers now, each contributing to the asphyxiation of South Africa. If South Africa lose another wicket now, their heads could go completely. Markram has a wild slap across the line and is beaten on the inside – but he then takes advantage of a freebie on the pads, clipping over square leg for four. That’s the first boundary of the game from the 52nd delivery. 8th over: South Africa 10-2 (van der Dussen 4, Markram 1) Hazlewood beats van der Dussen again, prompting Cummins to bring in a third slip. Van der Dussen tries to something, anything, by walking down and across to clip a single to mid-on. As a neutral this is grimly compelling, but it must be a horrible experience for any South African fans. “The thing is that it wouldn’t have been a case of dropping Bavuma,” says Tim Doyle. “It would have been a case of of leaving him out because he’s not fit. Just as New Zealand left Kane Williamson out of several games because of his leg and then finger injuries. A World Cup semi-final against Australia is no place for an injured opener and it suggests a leadership team reluctant to make the tough calls.” I think, admittedly from afar, that it’s more complicated than that. Pat Cummins would have played today if he was 90 per cent fit. Don’t get me wrong, I do think South Africa would probably be a better team right now with Hendricks opening, but it’s an extremely delicate situation. Had they dropped their captain and then lost, they’d have been savaged for panicking and overthinking. I wouldn’t have fancied Hendricks’ chances in these conditions either. 7th over: South Africa 8-2 (van der Dussen 3, Markram 0) Van der Dussen is beaten three times in the course of a brilliant over from Starc. Warner’s third excellent diving stop ensured it was also a maiden. Look, this isn’t Johannesburg 1999, but conditions are much tougher for batting than South Africa would have expected. All they wanted was to bat first on a dry, flat, hard pitch. Helpful bowling conditions are all well and good but you have to take advantage of them. Australia have been intimidatingly good both with the ball and in the field. “Is it time,” says Stephen Cottrell, “for the giant from Twin Peaks yet?” 6th over: South Africa 8-2 (van der Dussen 3, Markram 0) Aidan Markram is beaten by his first ball, a nasty lifting legcutter. Hazlewood, who has bowled forensically in helpful conditions, has figures are 3-1-3-1. This is a huge wicket. The pressure of dot balls finally got to de Kock, who crashed the ball miles in the air back over Hazlewood’s head. Cummins backpedalled urgently from mid-on to take a brilliant two-handed catch above his head – and he held on as the force of the blow knocked him off his feet. It was almost identical to Kane Williamson’s catch to dismiss Rohit Sharma yesterday. But this is an even bigger wicket: de Kock has gone for 3 from 14 balls. Pat Cummins takes an immense catch to get rid of Quinton de Kock! 5th over: South Africa 8-1 (de Kock 3, van der Dussen 3) There’s a bit of swing for Starc – nothing extravagant, but enough to make the batters wary. Van der Dussen tries to land the first counter-punch, walking across to crack a drive that is brilliantly stopped by the diving Warner in the covers. Warner does it again next ball, this time diving to his left. He’ll start his innings on 8 not out. Van der Dussen eventually gets a back-foot drive past him for a couple of runs. The score doesn’t look great for South Africa, and that’s an understatement, but it’s essential they survive this new-ball spell. We know they can catch up later on. “Good morning Rob from a sunny Cape Town,” writes Trevor Tutu. “I was half-minded to stay at home and watch the match on telly, but my conscientiousness kicked in and I set out for work, safe in the knowledge that the OBO would keep me informed. “And what happens when I turn to the OBO? Bavuma is out before he was even in! You are going to have to pull your socks up Rob, if the Proteas are to get to the 350 they need to make this match safe.” 350 indeed. 4th over: South Africa 6-1 (de Kock 3, van der Dussen 1) Winning the toss should have been a huge advantage; instead, on a sweaty pitch, it looks like a mixed blessing. South Africa were affected by the weather when they were eliminated in 1992, 2003 and 2015, but they probably thought they were safe in Kolkata. Hazlewood continues to bowl as if it’s a Test match. He goes up on his own for caught behind after beating van der Dussen with an extravagant legcutter, and another terrific over ends with van der Dussen inside-edging a single. Had he missed that he would probably have been LBW. 3rd over: South Africa 4-1 (de Kock 2, van der Dussen 0) de Kock is beaten, chasing a wide outswinger from Starc, and the only runs from the over are a leg-bye and a wide. These are dangerous times for South Africa. If they lose de Kock – who has already made four centuries at this tournament, including a tremendous 109 against Australia in Lucknow – the ghosts of World Cup past will be screeching. “Just the start we didn’t need!” writes Duncan Bonnett. “Temba should not have been in the side today anyway – still not 100 per cent fit, by his own admission, and woefully out of form in the World Cup. Reeza Hendricks would definitely have been a better pick, with Markram as skipper.” I know what you mean, and Hendricks batted superbly against England, but it would have been an extraordinary call to drop the captain for a World Cup semi-final. Is there any precedent for that? I feel really sad for Bavuma, who came into this tournament in spectacular form but hasn’t got past 35. 2nd over: South Africa 2-1 (de Kock 2, van der Dussen 0) Josh Hazlewood’s first delivery lifts and seams to beat de Kock, who then edges wide of slip for a single. The new batter Rassie van der Dussen keeps out a good nipbacker and is cut in half by a jaffa. That’s a fantastic start from Hazlewood. The overhead conditions are a bit of a gamechanger, and Australia are on the prowl. South Africa need to treat the first 10 overs like a Test match. 1st over: South Africa 1-1 (de Kock 1, van der Dussen 0) We’ve all been talking about 1999 this week but there’s another precedent South Africa will be mindful of – their shambolic, overeager batting performance against Australia in the 2007 semi-final. Temba Bavuma has gone for a fourth-ball duck. It was a fine delivery from Starc – tight line, just back of a length – and Bavuma snicked a defensive push through to Josh Inglis. Not quite the perfect start for Australia, because they’ve have preferred to dismiss Quinton de Kock, but it’s not far short. Goddim! Mitchell Starc will open the bowling. He hasn’t had a great tournament – 10 wickets at 44 – but it’s overcast and the new ball should swing. This is his chance. ICYMI South Africa are about to play Australia in a World Cup semi-final, and it is gargantuan. May the best team meet India in the final on Sunday. “Re: your comment about a reserve day,” begins Jonathan. “Are all 20-over match thrashes or just this hypothetical one? I fear the T20 purists would object to such a word.” So would anyone with a half-decent command of language, but I’d just stumbled out of bed and my brain only presented me with a couple of options. I reluctantly concluded that ‘20-over thrash’ was preferable to ‘desperate 20-over arsenipper’. “Well here we are, Rob,” says Guy Hornsby. “What’s par on this pitch? SA winning the toss is massive (which is a shame really, as was yesterday) and they’ll want to go big so will Australia be happy chasing anything over 320? I’d assume not. And that SA will want to bat them out of the game, with 350+. “Also a big shout to Marnus, who having been left out of the squad, is now a lock. I’m not sure he and Smith together is great in a chase (or generally) and while it feels like heresy, I’d have picked Stoinis over the great man, who doesn’t seem who he once was in the short format. Everything ends in the end, I guess.” Have you been watching Six Feet Under again? I’ve no idea what a par score is, as I don’t have a great view of the pitch from my office in Bruton. But my instinct, based on the experts’ views, is that it’s between 280 and 320. The first 10 overs are vital for South Africa because the new balls should do a bit. It’s important they don’t lose early wickets plural. Trigger warning Ricky Ponting says Adam Zampa is Australia’s most important player. The stats back him up. In ODI victories he has taken 121 wickets at 20.83; in defeats his record is 41 at 48.97. Pitch report Matthew Hayden, once again wearing his magnificent pink fedora, thinks there will be plenty of turn as the match progresses. He also says South Africa need a minimum score of 300. Ali Martin’s preview Temba Bavuma says he isn’t 100 per cent fit, though he was never going to miss this game. South Africa bring in Tabraiz Shamsi for Lungi Ngidi, which means the feisty Gerald Coetzee keeps his place. Bavuma didn’t specify whether Ngidi was injured or omitted. Australia bring back two big guns, Mitchell Starc and Glenn Maxwell, for Sean Abbott and Marcus Stoinis. That means they’ve kept the middle-order insurance of Marnus Labuschagne. South Africa de Kock (wk), Bavuma (c), van der Dussen, Markram, Klaasen, Miller, Jansen, Coetzee, Maharaj, Rabada, Shamsi. Australia Head, Warner, Marsh, Smith, Labuschagne, Maxwell, Inglis (wk), Cummins (c), Starc, Zampa, Hazlewood. Temba Bavuma humours Mike Atherton by saying he considered bowling first because of the conditions. Pat Cummins would also have batted, though he doesn’t seem too disappointed. The new ball should swing given the overhead conditions. The covers are off and it looks like we’re going to start on time. Seven of the likely Australian XI were part of the squad that won the 2015 World Cup. This is their last dance. Glenn Maxwell came into this World Cup as a handy bowler who used to bat. It’s fair to say that is no longer the case. The covers are on in Kolkata, so the start is likely to be delayed. The forecast for rain adds another layer of intrigue to this game. Both teams will surely bat first if they win the toss – South Africa because they want to, Australia because South Africa want to – but a reduced runchase would muddy those particular waters. There is a reserve day if necessary, though the umpires will make every attempt to finish the match today, even if that means a 20-over thrash. Look, it was always going to be like this. As the penny dropped, in the first fortnight of the World Cup, that South Africa were serious contenders, the cricket world instinctively understood that they would have to beat Australia at some stage. Not in the league stage – though they did that handsomely – but in the knockouts, when it really counts. One statistic tells the story of this game. South Africa are hoping to reach their first World Cup final; Australia expect to reach their eighth. This is a humdinger of a semi-final between two teams who have more in common than they would ever dare admit – and fundamental differences that South Africa need to overcome. The history of this fixture is simple: Australia win the games that really matter. In that context, South Africa’s outstanding run of 16 wins in the last 20 ODIs against Australia is almost ominous, because none of those games were anywhere near as big as this. But they have a proven template to beat Australia, and everyone else for that matter: win the toss, bat first, bat big, ideally huge. They are too good not to crack this thing eventually. We’re about to find out whether today is the day.",

Ross said Matheson had misled Holyrood: “It wasn’t just a mistake; it was dishonest.”</p> \n  <p><strong>Matheson</strong> in his statement admitted one of his sons had watched football using his parliamentary iPad as a data hotspot: on Sunday 2 January, Celtic played Rangers in the Scottish Premier League. According to figures released by Holyrood officials, nearly 3.8Gb of data was used that day, at a cost of £8,666.</p> \n  <p>Fighting back tears at several points, Matheson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mistakes have been made by me and mistakes have been made by my family, and mistakes have been made in the way I have handled this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The scandal erupted last week after it emerged he had racked up an £11,000 roaming charges bill on his parliamentary iPad during a week-long Christmas holiday in Morocco, and refused to explain why.</p> \n  <p>He insisted to Holyrood’s authorities and to Humza Yousaf, the first minister, those charges were legitimately incurred on parliamentary business: Holyrood officials accepted his assurances and agreed to pay nearly £8,000 of that bill and allowed him to put the remainder on his parliamentary expenses.</p> \n  <p>After days of intense pressure on Matheson and parliamentary authorities to explain how that bill was incurred, Holyrood released his daily data charges, revealing that usage spiked on Sunday 2 January. It also emerged Matheson had ignored repeated requests to update his sim card, which was by then out of contract, and his iPad data settings, and had failed to tell officials he was taking it overseas.</p> \n  <p><strong>Jackie Baillie</strong>, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, said this had raised “serious questions” over his judgment, in part because Matheson’s attention was diverted during this crisis from tackling the NHS’s significant crises, and whether this meant his iPad had not been kept secure.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"088791a0ed00846d16b39f2b7bbd2b6c55c7d63a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/088791a0ed00846d16b39f2b7bbd2b6c55c7d63a/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Matheson in the Scottish parliament today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Matheson in the Scottish parliament today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken Jack/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2023-11-16T15:07:00.929Z\">at 3.07pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-65561d238f088603929f30e3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-11-16T14:47:00.600Z\">2.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lord Cameron could be questioned by MPs as foreign secretary in special sessions in Westminster Hall, Commons leader hints</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>David Cameron could end up taking questions from MPs in his new role as foreign secretary in special sessions in Westminster Hall, a cabinet minister hinted this morning.</p> \n  <p>Because he will be doing the job as a menber of the House of Lords, MPs will not be able to question Cameron in the Commons chamber. Andrew Mitchell, the development minister, will take the lead in answering questions there on behalf of the Foreign Office.</p> \n  <p>During business questions in the Commons this morning <strong>Lucy Powell</strong>, the shadow leader of the Commons, said a mechanism must be set up to allow MPs to question Cameron.</p> \n  <p>She said that, when Gordon Brown was prime minister and he gave senior cabinet jobs to two peers, Lord Mandelson and Lord Adonis, the Commons procedure committee drew up <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmproced/496/496.pdf\">a plan</a> to allow them to be questioned by MPs in Westminter Hall, the Commons annex used for minor debates. Those sessions never took place, because the 2010 election came first, but Powell said the government should adopt the same policy for Cameron now.</p> \n  <p><strong>Penny Mordaunt</strong>, leader of the Commons, implied the government would be open to this. She said Powell should be “reassured” that this was being considered and went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr Speaker has taken advice on the matter. My understanding is that the procedure committee will be consulted on the best way forward. [Powell] alluded to some of the options that may be required of the new foreign secretary, who I know will want to be accountable to this house. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-655625388f088603929f3148\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-11-16T14:29:13.896Z\">2.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government has not even published its “emergency” Rwanda legislation asserting the country is safe for asylum seekers, but Conservative MPs are already lobbying to amend it, ITV’s <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> reports.

He told the News at 10 last night:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have never heard of them trying to change the facts, by law. For as long as black isn’t white, the business of passing acts of parliament to say that it is profoundly discreditable.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And in an interview with the Today programme podcast, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have never heard of a situation in which parliament intervenes to declare the facts – the safety or unsafety of Rwanda – to change the facts from those which have been declared by the courts to be correct.</p> \n   <p>The courts have perused hundreds of pages of documents to arrive at this conclusion.

Keir Starmer had a difficult night yesterday, after 56 of his MPs, including eight shadow ministers (or ex shadow ministers, as they are now), rebelled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/15/commons-gaza-vote-labour-defy-starmer-ceasefire-israel\">in the Gaza ceasefire vote</a>, but Rishi Sunak’s problems over the Rwanda supreme court judgment are undoubtedly a lot more serious.</p> \n  <p>Partly it’s an electoral problem; on a priority issue, his policy has fallen apart, and it is not clear yet whether the alternative strategy announced yesterday afternoon will enable Rwanda flights to actually happen. But, as or more seriously, it is also a party management issue. The Rwanda decision has emboldened the many Tory MPs who want the UK to withdraw from the European convention on human rights, and Sunak’s response – sounding up for that, but not convincingly – may not be enough to contain them.</p> \n  <p>All of which helps to explain why what in other circumstances might be a piece of Westminster gossip might be quite important.

                "bodyText": "Lisa Nandy, the shadow international development miniser, has defended her support for transgender rights after JK Rowling criticised her as “one of the biggest reasons many women on the left no longer trust”. Asked about the comment at a press gallery lunch at Westminster, Nandy said: It breaks my heart actually, we’re re-reading Harry Potter at the moment in my house with an eight-year-old who is absolutely Harry Potter obsessed. And I don’t think we should end up in an oppositional relationship where we’re talking about some of the most marginalised, discriminated against women and girls on the planet, and we can’t have that debate – because there’s a genuine conversation to be had about the rights of transgender people and the protection of safe spaces and hard-fought rights for women. Nandy also complained that the debate on trans right was “based on fear, and creating fear about a group of people who are having a very, very tough time”. She went on: When we look at the way we reduce the debate to things like bodily parts, I think when we look back in history we will be utterly ashamed of ourselves. Here is John Crace’s sketch on James Cleverly’s outing on the airwaves this morning. Sixty senior women at the UK’s Ministry of Defence have described a “hostile” and “toxic” culture at the department in a letter that alleges sexual assault, harassment and abuse by male colleagues, Harry Davies, Dan Sabbagh and Rowena Mason report. Keir Starmer has said that having the right policy for people in Gaza is more important to him than Labour unity. In an interview with ITV News, asked about the vote last night that saw 56 Labour MPs defy the party whip, Starmer said: Of course, I want us to move forward as united as we can as a party, but you wouldn’t expect me to stand here today and say my concern is the Labour party management rather than the hostages and the innocent civilians and children that are dying in Gaza. My focus and attention is there, and that’s where it is and where it will always be. Labour frontbenchers who voted with the SNP in favour of a ceasefire in Gaza last night have paid the consequences, losing their shadow roles as a result. But some of those who stayed loyal are also feeling the heat today, not least Rushanara Ali, the MP for Bethnal Green and Bow. Hundreds of students are marching today to her constituency office to protest at her decision, while more are expected to turn up later. Ali is receiving abuse and veiled threats on X. Bethnal Green and Bow is, of course, the “safe” Labour seat which the party unexpectedly lost to George Galloway in 2005 following the Iraq war - a seat where 41% of voters are Muslim. Ali will hope last night doesn’t trigger a repeat of that result at the next election. Michael Matheson, Scotland’s embattled health secretary, has apologised “unreservedly” to the Scottish parliament after admitting he failed to properly disclose that his sons had largely rung up an £11,000 iPad bill he initially charged in full to taxpayers. In a personal statement to MSPs after first ministers’ questions on Thursday, Matheson said he had referred himself for possible investigation by parliament for breaching its code of conduct, as he fought against mounting calls from opposition leaders for his resignation. During first minister’s questions on Thursday, Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, called on Matheson to quit and came as close as parliamentary rules allowed to accuse him of lying to MSPs. Ross said Matheson had misled Holyrood: “It wasn’t just a mistake; it was dishonest.” Matheson in his statement admitted one of his sons had watched football using his parliamentary iPad as a data hotspot: on Sunday 2 January, Celtic played Rangers in the Scottish Premier League. According to figures released by Holyrood officials, nearly 3.8Gb of data was used that day, at a cost of £8,666. Fighting back tears at several points, Matheson said: Mistakes have been made by me and mistakes have been made by my family, and mistakes have been made in the way I have handled this. The scandal erupted last week after it emerged he had racked up an £11,000 roaming charges bill on his parliamentary iPad during a week-long Christmas holiday in Morocco, and refused to explain why. He insisted to Holyrood’s authorities and to Humza Yousaf, the first minister, those charges were legitimately incurred on parliamentary business: Holyrood officials accepted his assurances and agreed to pay nearly £8,000 of that bill and allowed him to put the remainder on his parliamentary expenses. After days of intense pressure on Matheson and parliamentary authorities to explain how that bill was incurred, Holyrood released his daily data charges, revealing that usage spiked on Sunday 2 January. It also emerged Matheson had ignored repeated requests to update his sim card, which was by then out of contract, and his iPad data settings, and had failed to tell officials he was taking it overseas. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, said this had raised “serious questions” over his judgment, in part because Matheson’s attention was diverted during this crisis from tackling the NHS’s significant crises, and whether this meant his iPad had not been kept secure. David Cameron could end up taking questions from MPs in his new role as foreign secretary in special sessions in Westminster Hall, a cabinet minister hinted this morning. Because he will be doing the job as a menber of the House of Lords, MPs will not be able to question Cameron in the Commons chamber. Andrew Mitchell, the development minister, will take the lead in answering questions there on behalf of the Foreign Office. During business questions in the Commons this morning Lucy Powell, the shadow leader of the Commons, said a mechanism must be set up to allow MPs to question Cameron. She said that, when Gordon Brown was prime minister and he gave senior cabinet jobs to two peers, Lord Mandelson and Lord Adonis, the Commons procedure committee drew up a plan to allow them to be questioned by MPs in Westminter Hall, the Commons annex used for minor debates. Those sessions never took place, because the 2010 election came first, but Powell said the government should adopt the same policy for Cameron now. Penny Mordaunt, leader of the Commons, implied the government would be open to this. She said Powell should be “reassured” that this was being considered and went on: Mr Speaker has taken advice on the matter. My understanding is that the procedure committee will be consulted on the best way forward. [Powell] alluded to some of the options that may be required of the new foreign secretary, who I know will want to be accountable to this house. The government has not even published its “emergency” Rwanda legislation asserting the country is safe for asylum seekers, but Conservative MPs are already lobbying to amend it, ITV’s Anushka Asthana reports. She says they are pushing for the inclusion of something like notwithstanding clauses, allowing the European convention on human rights to be ignored. Hearing dozens of Tory MPs are writing to PM today demanding that emergency Rwanda legislation is protected from human rights challenges. They want notwithstanding clauses; to dis-apply the HRA; &amp; last min “pyjama injunctions” to be blocked The feeling is the PM went further than expected but also that the proposals will still get tangled up with Lords and then in courts - and so they are sceptical about the timeline and fear a flight will not be able to get out before the next election. Sir John Hayes was one of several Tories calling for notwithstanding legislation yesterday. They are referring to clauses in a law saying, “notwithstanding” what the European convention on human rights says, the government is entitled to ignore those obligations. Many lawyers argue in practice clauses like this would never work. Labour has a 23-point lead over the Conservatives, according to the latest polling from YouGov. A Commons deputy speaker and a Tory MP are under investigation by the Commons standards watchdog, PA Media reports. PA says: Commons’ standards commissioner Daniel Greenberg is looking into allegations that Dame Eleanor Laing and Virginia Crosbie, MP for Ynys Môn, may have broken rules for MPs. The allegations relate to “actions causing significant damage to the reputation of the house as a whole, or of its members generally”. The commissioner has not released any further details regarding the inquiry. The pair previously faced questions about a gathering in parliament on 8 December 2020. The gathering, said to have been arranged by Dame Eleanor, was cited by Boris Johnson in a statement accusing Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin of “monstrous hypocrisy” for allegedly attending the event before sitting on the cross-party panel which found the former prime minister had lied to MPs with his Partygate denials. Crosbie apologised earlier this year for attending an event in parliament while Covid restrictions were still in place. James Johnson, a pollster who used to work in No 10 for Theresa May, has posted on X a thread with findings from a focus group for Times Radio involving swing voters. He says the results are the worst for the Conservatives since he started doing these groups in 2020. It starts here. *Worst focus group for the Conservatives since we started this series in 2020. * Views of PM Rishi Sunak: - “Failed” - “Meek, no real presence” - “Money, upper class” ... (1/6) Downing Street has said that the “emergency legislation” on Rwanda promised by Rishi Sunak yesterday will be produced “in the coming weeks”. Speaking at the No 10 lobby briefing, the PM’s spokesperson said the bill would “make clear Rwanda is safe on the basis of the work we have done” over the last 15 months and the “upgraded assurances we have secured to address the court’s concerns in our new treaty”. The treaty will provide a “guarantee” that the risks of refoulement – the process of returning refugees to their origin countries – identified by the court will not materialise, the spokesperson said. Yesterday Sunak said the legislation would make it clear that the UK regards Rwanda as a safe country. Boris Johnson has also called for this, implying it could be done by secondary legislation, but No 10 said there would be primary legislation – meaning there will be a bill that will have to go through the House of Lords as well as the Commons. The spokesperson also claimed that that the new legislation prevent “systemic challenges” to the Rwanda policy. He said: The approach we have seen where people challenge the principle of our Rwanda policy, that will be dealt with through the emergency legislation. We think this is the fastest route through to getting flights in the air. We think by closing off these avenues of challenge it will help speed through the process. At his Institute for Government Q&amp;A Sir Mark Rowley, commissioner of the Metropolitan police, refused to say what he felt about Lee Anderson, the Conservative party deputy chair, declaring yesterday that ministers should just ignore the supreme court judgment saying the Rwanda police was unlawful. Asked to respond, Rowley just said: Politicians hold me to account, I don’t hold them to account. Keir Starmer has attacked the UK government’s “unforgivable” trade strategy during a visit to a Scottish distillery, PA Media reports. PA says: Starmer travelled north of the border just hours after a revolt within his party over a ceasefire in Gaza resulted in the resignation of eight of his frontbenchers. The Labour leader highlighted what he described as the “failure” of the UK government to negotiate a trade deal with India, a key exporter for Scotch whisky. Visiting the InchDairnie distillery in Glenrothes, Fife, Starmer said a government he leads would put in place a trade strategy that would “back Scotch producers to the hilt”. James Cleverly, the home secretary, has hinted the government may tighten the law to stop protesters climbing on war memorials. He was responding to a question about an incident last night when a pro-Palestinian protester climbed to the top of the large Royal Artillery Memorial at Hyde Park Corner in London. Cleverly, who served in the Royal Artillery, told LBC: We’re going to look at this. I’m not going to let my personal feelings cloud my judgment on this but it is clearly wrong, and the police have said that they recognise it is deeply disrespectful for people to climb on war memorials. We have made a commitment to review the legislation around public order policing. If the police – and I’m going to look at this in real detail – if the police need more powers to make sure that really deeply distasteful, provocative things like that do not happen for the public good, because of course this is about making sure it doesn’t stimulate violent action or any kind of violent responses, but if we need to take action specifically to give police more powers, we are looking at doing that. Johnny Mercer, the veterans minister, issued a statement implying the police should have stopped protesters getting on the monument. Sir Mark Rowley, commissioner of the Metropolitan police, was asked about the incident in a Q&amp;A at the Institute for Government thinktank this morning and he defended the officers involved. He said it was “not illegal to climb on to a statue”, and he said it would have been wrong for the officers to “make up a law” and perform an arrest which would have been illegal. Instead the officers sought to deescalate the situation by asking the protesters to climb down, which they did, Rowley said. He also said that it was for the government, not him, to decide whether climbing on war memorials should be criminalised. The chief scientist whose diary entries contained revelations that Boris Johnson described coronavirus as “nature’s way of dealing with old people” is set to appear before the UK’s public inquiry next week, PA Media reports. PA says: Sir Patrick Vallance is expected to give evidence on Monday followed by England’s former chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty and his former deputy, Sir Jonathan Van-Tam later in the week. Vallance has objected to the publication of his pandemic-era diary in full, describing the notes as a “brain dump” written “at the end of immensely stressful days to protect his mental health”. But further extracts could be put before the inquiry as he answers questions from lawyers about his time in office during the government’s response to the virus next week. His evidence will be followed by Whitty on Tuesday and Van-Tam next Wednesday, according to a timetable published by the inquiry on Thursday. Dame Angela McLean will also appear next Wednesday, while the business secretary and equalities minister, Kemi-Badenoch; and Dame Jenny Harries, a former deputy chief medical officer for England, are expected next Thursday. Here is the timetable from the inquiry’s website. In his interviews this morning James Cleverly, the home secretary, also dismissed the debate within the Conservative party about whether the UK would need to withdraw from the European convention on human rights (ECHR) to implement the Rwanda policy as a distraction. Speaking on Times Radio, he said the government’s “preferred option” was to remain within the ECHR. He went on: This is a distracting conversation. I get it is of interest, legitimate interest, but the point I have made is I, the prime minister, the government, will not be distracted from focusing on what we have been told by the supreme court judges needs to be fixed in order to get this out of the way. Later, on the Today programme, he said: I don’t believe [withdrawal from the ECHR] will be necessary. I believe that we can act in accordance with international law and we are very determined to do that. Yesterday, in a statement during his press conference, Rishi Sunak implied that he would be willing, if necessary, to withdraw from the ECHR. He declared: Let me tell everyone now – I will not allow a foreign court to block these flights. If the Strasbourg court chooses to intervene against the express wishes of parliament, I am prepared to do what necessary to get flights off. But this may just have been a reference to Sunak’s objection to one aspect of how the European court of human rights operates – its use of interim injunctions, like the one that blocked the government’s first flight to Rwanda. Sunak also said, in response to questions, that he did not think ECHR withdrawal would be necessary. Yesterday the supreme court said the Rwanda policy was unlawful on the grounds that Rwanda is not a safe country for asylum seekers because there is a real risk they will suffer “refoulement” – return to their home country where they were at risk of persecution. In its response, the government said that it was negotiating a treaty with Rwanda to address these concerns, and that it would pass legislation asserting that Rwanda is safe. Lord Sumption, a former supreme court judge, has dismissed the notion that legislation like this would make any difference. He told the News at 10 last night: I have never heard of them trying to change the facts, by law. For as long as black isn’t white, the business of passing acts of parliament to say that it is profoundly discreditable. And in an interview with the Today programme podcast, he said: I have never heard of a situation in which parliament intervenes to declare the facts – the safety or unsafety of Rwanda – to change the facts from those which have been declared by the courts to be correct. The courts have perused hundreds of pages of documents to arrive at this conclusion. For parliament simply to say the facts are different would be constitutionally really quite extraordinary. This morning, in his interview on the Today programme, James Cleverly, the home secretary, said he did not accept Sumption’s argument. When it was put to him that Sumption was a former supreme court justice, Cleverly replied: Lawyers argue all the time, that’s literally what they do. I have very eminent lawyers who take a different view. Cleverly also argued that the new treaty with Rwanda would address the concerns raised by the court. He said: We have been working with the Rwandans to beef up, to strengthen, to professionalise and enhance their professional institutions, we’ve been doing this throughout this last year. The supreme court is only able to look at the facts as presented to the appeal court, which was 15 months ago, and we have not wasted the intervening months. We have been working extensively with the Rwandans on this very issue. So we are confident that the treaty, the legally binding treaty which is binding on both countries, will be robust, will address the issues raised by the supreme court – because we have been working on it for over a year. The government has already given Rwanda £140m as part of its deportation deal, even though not one asylum seeker has yet been sent to the country. Asked about this on LBC, James Cleverly, the home secretary, said he would not be apologising for spending this money. He claimed the policy was already having a deterrent effect. He said I’m going to be really clear on this. I make no apology at all for spending money protecting this nation. It is the primary function of government. We know that even before the first flight has taken off the Rwanda policy is having a deterrent effect. We interview people that have attempted to come here through illegal migration and we know that people have been dissuaded from coming to the UK because of the fear of Rwanda scheme. Ministers are “absolutely determined” to get a removal flight to Rwanda off before the next election, and will finish drafting a legally binding treaty with the country “within days”, James Cleverly, the new home secretary, said in interviews this morning. Emily Dugan has the story. David Cameron, the new foreign secretary, has gone to gone to Kyiv in his first visit in his new role for talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy has posted this video on X. Cameron said: What I want to say by being here is we will continue to give you the moral support, the diplomatic support, the economic support, but above all the military support that you need, not just this year, and next year, but however long it takes. Geneva Abdul has more coverage on our Ukraine live blog. Good morning. Keir Starmer had a difficult night yesterday, after 56 of his MPs, including eight shadow ministers (or ex shadow ministers, as they are now), rebelled in the Gaza ceasefire vote, but Rishi Sunak’s problems over the Rwanda supreme court judgment are undoubtedly a lot more serious. Partly it’s an electoral problem; on a priority issue, his policy has fallen apart, and it is not clear yet whether the alternative strategy announced yesterday afternoon will enable Rwanda flights to actually happen. But, as or more seriously, it is also a party management issue. The Rwanda decision has emboldened the many Tory MPs who want the UK to withdraw from the European convention on human rights, and Sunak’s response – sounding up for that, but not convincingly – may not be enough to contain them. All of which helps to explain why what in other circumstances might be a piece of Westminster gossip might be quite important. Tory rightwingers liked having Suella Braverman as home secretary, but now they’ve got James Cleverly. And in the Commons yesterday Yvette Cooper, his Labour shadow, alleged that in private Cleverly had described the Rwanda policy as “batshit”. Cleverly has been doing an interview round this morning and, while not the main focus, this issue has come up. Although he did not admit using the phrase, anyone watching or listening to his interviews will conclude that he did indeed, at least once in private, describe the centrepiece of the government’s policy for dealing with irregular migration, beloved of rightwingers, as “batshit”. Asked about the comment on Sky News, he replied: “I don’t recognise that phrase.” Asked again on BBC Breakfast, he “squirmed” (in the words of the Mirror) and said this was a claim made about him, not by him, and claimed he could not remember using the word. And when the question got asked again on the Today programme, Cleverly laughed unconvincingly and claimed the interviewer was falling into a trap laid by Labour. All of which means that Sunak has appointed a new home secretary who – almost certainly, at least once – has expressed views on the Rwanda policy more in line with those of Guardian readers than Daily Mail readers. In the Conservative party, that will have been noted. I will post more from the Cleverly interviews soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Sir Jon Thompson, the HS2 executive chair, gives evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about the Euston station project. 11am: Sir Mark Rowley, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, speaks at an Institute for Government event. 11.20am: James Cleverly speaks at the joint annual summit of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners and National Police Chiefs’ Council. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2pm: Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, joins Bill Clinton, the former US president, and his wife, Hillary, the former US secretary of state, on a visit to Swansea University.

                "body": "<p>For 27-year-old Olly Brown, the impact of Scotland’s rent cap on his bank balance is indivisible from the effect on his peace of mind. “It’s the longest I’ve lived in the same place for the whole of my adult life,” says the market researcher, who rents a one-bedroom flat near Haymarket in Edinburgh.</p> <p>“I never thought that a rental property could feel like a home,” he says, “but now I have plants and I’ve been able to decorate a bit. It actually feels like my place.”</p> <p>In September 2022, the Scottish government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/06/nicola-sturgeon-announces-rent-freeze-for-tenants-in-scortland\">introduced a cap</a> on all in-tenancy rent increases in the private rented sector. The emergency legislation, which also included protections against eviction, was intended as a temporary response to the cost of living crisis, and was led by the SNP’s governing partners, the Scottish Greens.</p> <p>It sets the cap at 3% in a single year, although a landlord can enter a tribunal process to increase rent up to 6% if they are able to prove extenuating hardship. In practice this has rarely been attempted.</p> <p>“The cap is a reassurance that I’m not going to face a huge hike,” says Brown. He knew from friends that it was getting harder to find affordable properties in the city centre as more people returned to the office after the pandemic. “When I look at similar properties, they’re going for £200-£300 more than I’m paying per month. But because of the cap, I don’t have a constant lingering worry about when I have to move out.”</p> <p>Ariane Burgess, the Scottish Greens’ housing spokesperson, says the rent cap has been “one of the most significant pieces of work that we’ve done” since coming into government. “It’s giving people stability and security during the cost of living crisis and it’s saved individuals hundreds of pounds.”</p> <p>She is quick to point out that despite growing outcry about cavalier treatment of tenants’ rights, no other part of the UK has considered such a cap. “Scotland is leading the way in this regard. But we’re also making Scotland normal in terms of other EU countries, where the rented sector is bigger and much better regulated.”</p> <p>Announcing his programme for government this autumn, the first minister, Humza Yousaf, announced a housing bill to introduce <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/23769220.scottish-government-confirms-plans-rent-controls/\">long-term rent controls</a> and new tenant rights, which is expected to come before a Holyrood committee next summer.</p> <p>But the situation in the Scottish capital, in particular, has reached crisis point, with Edinburgh city council formally <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-67289581\">declaring a “housing emergency”</a> on 2 November, citing record homelessness figures, a chronic shortfall of social rented homes and the highest inflation in the private rental sector in the whole of the UK, at 13.7%.</p> <p>With the emergency measure due to expire in March, tenants such as Brown who have benefited from the cap are worried about what will happen until the new legislation comes into force.</p> <p>Others who should have been helped by the cap have discovered significant loopholes that they are urging the government to deal with before the change is made permanent.</p> <p>“Yes, Scotland has a form of rent control,” says Ruth Gilbert, the national campaigns chair of the Scotland-wide tenants’ union Living Rent, “but it doesn’t do anything to solve the serious crisis that has been ongoing for decades now, where we’ve seen huge rent increases across the country.”</p> <p>Gilbert says the union’s community meetings in Glasgow and Edinburgh regularly hear of cases where loopholes in the rent cap were exploited. When one member of a house or flatshare moves on, for example, there is nothing to prevent the landlord putting up the rent significantly for the new and remaining tenants.</p> <p>“Week in, week out we hear about letting agents increasing the rent because one tenant moved out of a share so the tenancy has been broken,” Gilbert says. In Living Rent’s proposed new deal for tenants is a call to give joint tenants the same rights as sole tenants.</p> <p>Similarly, Living Rent often hears about landlords giving tenants notice, claiming they intend to sell their property, only for it to reappear on the market a month later at a vastly inflated rental price.</p> <p>“A lot of them are just chancing it because the penalties in place aren’t severe enough,” Gilbert says.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/sep/14/loophole-in-scotlands-rent-controls-sees-new-tenants-facing-largest-rises-in-uk\">Guardian reported in September</a>, figures from Zoopla suggest Scotland’s landlords have used a loophole that lets them exceed the cap if they are drawing up a new tenancy agreement, with new tenancy costs up 12.7% in the year to July – more than in the next hottest markets, in London and north-west England.</p> <p>Living Rent’s new deal also proposes universal rent controls to bring rents down rather than simply stabilising a broken system, as well as greater protections against eviction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea339d21f9636812e2959fc496c2d1c874a9dbf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea339d21f9636812e2959fc496c2d1c874a9dbf3/0_0_5900_3538/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Perrie at a tenants meeting in Edinburgh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Perrie at a tenants meeting in Edinburgh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sofia Conti/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At a Living Rent branch meeting at the Fountain cafe near Edinburgh’s West End, new faces who have come seeking practical advice are welcomed and there are groans at the mention of a notorious local landlord.</p> <p>The rent cap is great but only up to a point, says Forest Mahi’ai, a 29-year-old student. Her landlady initially told her she was planning to sell, then offered a new tenancy contract with a £300-a-month increase.</p> <p>“She’s called 10 times in the past 24 hours but she won’t answer on email because she knows what she’s doing is a bit sketchy,” she says.</p> <p>Mahi’ai says she had hoped to finish her university course in the same place. “I share with my partner and we could make it at a squeeze, but it prevents us saving to buy our own property.”</p> <p>Mark Perrie, 27, a developer, had been living with his parents during the pandemic when he found a “cheapish” flat in Edinburgh. He got in touch with Living Rent when he found himself with a broken boiler and a letting agent who would not answer his calls.</p> <p>“I felt like an asset being traded about to get more cash out of me,” he said. “Most people don’t know much about the tenancy system so the union is a good way for regular people to empower themselves. There’s a real clamour for change.”</p>",

But we’re also making Scotland normal in terms of other EU countries, where the rented sector is bigger and much better regulated.” Announcing his programme for government this autumn, the first minister, Humza Yousaf, announced a housing bill to introduce long-term rent controls and new tenant rights, which is expected to come before a Holyrood committee next summer. But the situation in the Scottish capital, in particular, has reached crisis point, with Edinburgh city council formally declaring a “housing emergency” on 2 November, citing record homelessness figures, a chronic shortfall of social rented homes and the highest inflation in the private rental sector in the whole of the UK, at 13.7%. With the emergency measure due to expire in March, tenants such as Brown who have benefited from the cap are worried about what will happen until the new legislation comes into force. Others who should have been helped by the cap have discovered significant loopholes that they are urging the government to deal with before the change is made permanent. “Yes, Scotland has a form of rent control,” says Ruth Gilbert, the national campaigns chair of the Scotland-wide tenants’ union Living Rent, “but it doesn’t do anything to solve the serious crisis that has been ongoing for decades now, where we’ve seen huge rent increases across the country.” Gilbert says the union’s community meetings in Glasgow and Edinburgh regularly hear of cases where loopholes in the rent cap were exploited. When one member of a house or flatshare moves on, for example, there is nothing to prevent the landlord putting up the rent significantly for the new and remaining tenants. “Week in, week out we hear about letting agents increasing the rent because one tenant moved out of a share so the tenancy has been broken,” Gilbert says. In Living Rent’s proposed new deal for tenants is a call to give joint tenants the same rights as sole tenants. Similarly, Living Rent often hears about landlords giving tenants notice, claiming they intend to sell their property, only for it to reappear on the market a month later at a vastly inflated rental price. “A lot of them are just chancing it because the penalties in place aren’t severe enough,” Gilbert says. As the Guardian reported in September, figures from Zoopla suggest Scotland’s landlords have used a loophole that lets them exceed the cap if they are drawing up a new tenancy agreement, with new tenancy costs up 12.7% in the year to July – more than in the next hottest markets, in London and north-west England. Living Rent’s new deal also proposes universal rent controls to bring rents down rather than simply stabilising a broken system, as well as greater protections against eviction. At a Living Rent branch meeting at the Fountain cafe near Edinburgh’s West End, new faces who have come seeking practical advice are welcomed and there are groans at the mention of a notorious local landlord. The rent cap is great but only up to a point, says Forest Mahi’ai, a 29-year-old student. Her landlady initially told her she was planning to sell, then offered a new tenancy contract with a £300-a-month increase. “She’s called 10 times in the past 24 hours but she won’t answer on email because she knows what she’s doing is a bit sketchy,” she says. Mahi’ai says she had hoped to finish her university course in the same place. “I share with my partner and we could make it at a squeeze, but it prevents us saving to buy our own property.” Mark Perrie, 27, a developer, had been living with his parents during the pandemic when he found a “cheapish” flat in Edinburgh. He got in touch with Living Rent when he found himself with a broken boiler and a letting agent who would not answer his calls. “I felt like an asset being traded about to get more cash out of me,” he said. “Most people don’t know much about the tenancy system so the union is a good way for regular people to empower themselves. There’s a real clamour for change.”",

                "bodyText": "Pictures and videos posted online of yesterday’s ceasefire protests showed Capitol police scattering candles, which were originally laid out to mourn the 11,000 Palestinians killed by Israeli strikes. “This is a reflection of what our gov thinks of Palestinians. 11,000 candles representing the Palestinian lives murdered by Israel with US funding. The cops just stepped on them,” said Sumaya Awad, a member of New York City’s Democratic Socialists of America. At one point, video showed a Capitol police officer appearing to spit on the candles after kicking them around. Beth Miller, political director of Jewish Voice for Peace Action, has joined other activists in condemning Democrats including Joe Biden, following last night’s ceasefire demonstrations. “With every passing minute that president Biden and the Democratic party refuse to heed the calls of their voters and demand a ceasefire, more Palestinians in Gaza are being killed by Israeli airstrikes and siege. In their homes, schools, hospitals, and mosques, and by starvation, dehydration and disease,” she said. Tonight, hundreds of peaceful anti-war activists came to the DNC to call for an end to bombs and violence in order to save Palestinian and Israeli lives. They were met with brutal assaults by the police. The Democrats need to decide: will they stand on the side of peace and justice, or will they continue to support war and genocide?” she added. “Calling for a ceasefire is not a radical or fringe demand,” said Renée Paradis of the Democratic Socialists of America following last night’s ceasefire demonstrations. She added: “A supermajority of Americans and an even bigger majority of Democrats want a Ceasefire NOW. It’s the Democratic party that’s out of step with their own base, in favor of the politics of their big donors, providing full support for Israel’s genocidal actions.

We know lasting peace can only be achieved through a just end to the occupation, and call upon the federal government–who could stop the war tomorrow with a single phone call–to stop sending military aid to Israel.” Here are some images coming through the newswires of last night’s ceasefire demonstrations outside the Democratic National Committee’s building: Sumaya Awad, a member of New York City’s Democratic Socialists of America, condemned the Democratic party following last night’s ceasefire demonstrations, saying: “The Democratic party just showed exactly how it feels about its voters… The Israeli military just stormed a hospital in Gaza, airstrikes have killed over 4,500 children, and water is running out. Over 80% of Democratic voters are demanding a ceasefire and brought that message of peace to party leadership, who responded by unleashing an incredibly violent police attack on them.” Jewish Voice for Peace Action has also released a separate statement on last night’s ceasefire demonstrations, saying: “The activists were joined by faith leaders in calling for a ceasefire to end the Israeli military’s massacre of Palestinians, to facilitate a hostage exchange, and to ensure that humanitarian and medical aid can reach Palestinians in besieged Gaza. As hundreds of anti-war protestors assembled with 11,000 candles and signs calling for a ceasefire, DC police, many in riot gear, rushed the candlelight vigil and attacked protestors blocking some of the entrances to the doors of the DCCC. According to Jeff Ordower, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace Action, the DC police rushed the protestors without warning. ‘We’ve been doing actions in DC for decades, and have never had police refuse to talk to a police liaison.’” Organizers of last night’s ceasefire demonstrations has released a statement on the “violent police response”, saying that over 90 no-nviolent protesters were injured by capitol police. In a joint statement released by If Not Now, Jewish Voice for Peace Action and Democratic Socialists of America, the groups said: On Wednesday evening, a coalition of Jewish and allied protesters non-violently blocked one entrance to the DNC headquarters. Police violently attacked them, causing over 90 injuries, including being pepper sprayed, minor cuts and dragged by the hair … Protesters were choked and violently handled by multiple office[r]s at once, thrown against the wall, then grabbed and picked up and thrown down the front stairs. At least two protestors’ glasses were smashed by the police. Dozen of people were kicked, kneed and punched in the face by police officers. People were shoved down the stairs and tackled to the pavement by cops running at full speed.” Good morning, Capitol police clashed with dozens of demonstators outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington DC on Wednesday evening during a demonstration for a ceasefire in Gaza where Israeli forces have killed over 11,000 Palestinians in the last five weeks. Demonstrators linked arms in front of the DNC building where several Democratic representatives including House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries were inside for a campaign reception. “Which side are you on?” yelled some demonstrators while others wore black shirts with the words “Cease Fire Now.” Protestors said they wanted to block the building’s entrances and exits to force politicians to encounter their candlelight vigil, the Associated Press reports. However, clashes quickly erupted as police used pepper spray and fired chemical irritants into the crowd. One protestor told the Associated Press that police started “pulling on folks that are disabled or have chronic illnesses, pulling people to the ground.” Meanwhile, capitol police said that approximately 150 people were “illegally and violently protesting” and that one person was arrested “for assault on an officer.” The demonstration comes as Joe Biden maintained his refusal to call for a ceasefire. Speaking to reporters following his meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping on Wednesday night, Biden said, “Hamas has already said publicly that they plan on attacking Israel again…so the idea that they’re going to just stop and not do anything is not realistic.” Biden’s comments come as the UN security council backed a resolution on Wednesday night calling for “urgent extended humanitarian pauses” in Gaza. Here are other developments in US politics: The Senate has passed a stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown. The House ethics committee will not recommend punishment for New York’s Republican representative George Santos who is accused of fraud.",
